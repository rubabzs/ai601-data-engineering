###/r/cricket! 

When I sent them the questions I didn't now what I'd get back. And I guess -- from what I know about the sport-- it should have come as no surprise that their response was over 5 pages long! Here's a wonderfully in-depth look into what you'll find on /r/cricket.

Answers prepared by /u/Eyesallonfire, /u/ingreenheaven, /u/Jack47, /u/rreyv, /u/sunnydelish, and /u/TheAshes (r/cricket moderators).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.
