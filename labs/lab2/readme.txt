For the star  I chose 4 dimension tables Patients, Doctors, Test and Bed because these impact the business or hospital management system directly answering questions like:

1) Do we have enough beds for increasing patients?

2) Do we have enough equipments to conduct tests?

3) How many paid leaves should a doctor be allowed?

...

For the snowflake, I included examines and account as sub dimensions for doctor and patient respectively. For doctors because examination is a subjective thing depending on the qualification of the doctor it is very difficult to quantify the difference between good and bad examination but examination is still a very important factor but not as important as the doctor, same applies for the patient a patient might have an account in a Swiss bank indicating he can afford more tests and expensive medicine but its a weak indicator as someone from MCB might have more balance in his/her account.
