Of course if you take a bowling machine and somehow able to make it pitch this exact ball at exact pace and angle etc. and then try to hit it many times you may be able to hit a few because you were expecting it and hence it's not literally unplayable. But that's the thing here. The batter didn't know the bowler will do this. To add to that, at 86 mph even the slightest variations from the starting trajectory of the ball will become very challenging to hit and this was waaay big of a variation (swing). The bowl started angling in towards the batter in the air and when it reached the batter after being pitched it had swung to the opposite direction a considerable amount",plasma_evil,14,26-05-2024 23:58:32

His brain probably couldn’t even understand that the ball had changed direction let alone adjust the bat to cover it.
Tv is really really misleading. You can see the ball very very clearly but that is far far far from the reality of it
To add to. I should add that the majority of that movement happens very very late after the release from the bowlers hand which is an amazing indication of the bowlers skill. He’s not just throwing that thing faster than 99% of anyone in the whole world he’s also planning on and trying to predict and control that balls movement in the air to intentionally lead the batsman into that position and then get it past him into the sticks.

Mitchell Starc bowls an unplayable outswinger to dismiss Abhishek Sharma in IPL Final.,Should be the ball of the tournament. ,l5wus3e,">Someone explain to this non cricket person why this is so good.

It's less the swing(curve), and more the additional lateral deviation off the bounce (called ""seam"" movement) that fools the batter.

But it's really the combination of all the below:

* The ball swings (You should anticipate this with Starc, the outswinger to left hander is his normal delivery.)
* The ball swings late - The physics of Cricket Swing bowling are mildly complicated. But tl;dr it doesn't work above a certain speed. By bowling slightly too fast, it will only start deviating in the air at the last fraction of a second once the ball has slowed down enough to swing. Giving the batter much less time to react.
* At this point the ball is heading for the stumps so the batter is forced to play the ball with his bat or risk getting out LBW or bowled (which is how he got out eventually).
* on top of this, because of the good seam position from Starc's bowling. the ball hit's the seam of the ball and deviates away from the batter (the off side) even further when it bounces. There is some RNG to this, but Starc does everything right to make it happen.
* The ball deviates far enough to miss the bat, but not so far that it misses the stumps.

tbh, he was actually probably trying to catch the edge of the bat, and get the batter caught by one of the fielders behind the bat. the fielder to the right of the wicketkeeper (catcher) is specifically positioned for this exact purpose. But the end result was more spectacular.",Itrlpr,3,27-05-2024 17:55:24

So if the ball hit the sticks the batter is out. The batter just needs to stop the ball from hitting it with his bat. If they hit it well they can run “the bases” and score points but can be thrown out if they runs. They can also decided to not run and just keep batting. Like if the hit was a grounder to first they can just not run and bat again. Once they are out that’s it, but till then they keep batting and can keep scoring points.

He has to swing because he thinks it will hit the middle or left (leg) stump which leads to him being out.

Mitchell Starc bowls an unplayable outswinger to dismiss Abhishek Sharma in IPL Final.,Should be the ball of the tournament. ,l5t4b2h,"Being respectful, I disagree. The seam on tennis balls is so subtle that it has a negligible effect on its swing or spin. The seam on a cricket ball is much more prominent and divides the ball into two halves. Ball can be moved in the air or after pitching in various ways by specific positioning of the seam.

Also, in cricket you can deliberately keep one side of the ball smooth by polishing it and let the other side deteriorate, which causes swing later on in the game.

And I'm aware of the different surfaces of a tennis court, but a cricket pitch is so variable that it can change its nature within one game. Some factors such as sudden presence or absence of dew can make it more batting friendly or bowling friendly within a match itself, thus giving one side an advantage. But in tennis, however the conditions vary,  they vary equally for both the sides.",Addy_Stark,14,26-05-2024 22:54:53

As an immigrant I find baseball extremely boring and I have tried very hard to get in to the game but just could not. I would rather watch grass grow than watch baseball. Similarly I have tried very hard to like basketball and football and since last couple years I am slowly able to force myself to watch football. Before I used to find it very awkward that as soon as the game starts all players just pile on top of each other and game just stopped.

You can't bat again, except if it's Test cricket wherein you can bat twice, but that's it. On average, yes baseball pitchers bowl quicker but many cricket bowlers can also bowl 90+ mph. And cricketers don't use steroids . Using steroids in sports isn't something to be proud or tolerant about.

None of this is to say that baseball batters are overrated or that batting in baseball is easier than in cricket. Same goes for baseball pitchers/pitching and fielders/fielding.

It is indeed difficult to put the ball in play as a batter in baseball, because you got to focus only on the fair territory, which is the cone-shaped zone in front of you. And you can only hit and score if you put the ball there off of your bat. And it is indeed difficult to do all that. 

But that's exactly my point. This exact thing could be limiting for a baseball batter in cricket, because baseball batters only focus on that cone-shaped area in front (what we call 'the V' in cricket). In cricket, you're expected to be equipped enough to put the ball in, and score across, the whole 360°. So without training, baseball players won't be able to do that on a regular basis, and these are like cricket batting basics. It's not even advanced stuff. You have to know how to score all across the field by putting the ball in play all across the field depending on the ball being bowled to you. 

And what you said about Pakistan or Bangladesh is not just incredibly stereotypical, but also untrue. Pakistani and Bangladeshi cricketers are exposed to expansive cricket right at the grassroots level. At the professional international level, they receive top level sporting facilities and personnel. 

Assuming that throwing money at everything works, is a very generalised and faulty mindset. Americans are not exposed to grassroots level cricket facilities, nor do they have nearly enough training and cricketing infrastructure, or quality coaching personnel. They haven't thought enough about the dynamics of the sport, like Bangladeshis and Pakistan have. 

By your logic, the same Bangladeshis and Pakistanis can also throw money at developing baseball, and they can reach the same level as the US easily. But it doesn't work that way because Pakistan and Bangladesh have the same issue wrt baseball (the ones I mentioned and some more), as the US has with cricket. It's not just about the money here.

Football (soccer) is popular all across the world literally. And yet, you only have European and South American countries winning things, and the most competitive football leagues are also in only these regions. Why?? Coz money is not the only factor. What all I mentioned, are more important reasons for this.",5m1tm,13,14-06-2022 23:49:58

You've this misguided pride that baseball is better than cricket, and that Americans are better at everything. Like I said, that's like American exceptionalism 101.

Now, those are kind of guesswork based on standings, but he was against some VERY solid batsmen. Six wickets (outs) in a match is damn near unheard of.

"On his IPL debut, 22-year old Antiguan Alzarri Joseph comes up with the best bowling performance in a match in the history of the tournament",[ Removed by reddit in response to a copyright notice. ],ekatj0l,"This is really not the most accurate analogy my dear lad. Sticking with baseball here— imagine if on his debut, Stephen Strasburg (a mega hyped power arm who has been a celebrated top prospect since his teenage years), on a day that his team’s offense only scored 2 runs, thew a no hit shut out and struck out Josh Donaldson (a 32 year old former MVP), Starlin Castro (average player with upside), Craig Kimbrel (a relief pitcher), and Gio Gonzalez. Not quite the hall of fame mantle you say, but this is where the analogy ends as an out in cricket is not equivalent to an out in baseball— a batsmen might bat for dozens of pitches and once he’s out he doesn’t hit again. 

As far as this particular fella goes, he was one of the youngest call ups ever to the West Indies national team and while making his debut today, is a known commodity as a young talent with phenomenal potential. What makes him unique is the incredible amount of power he generates relative to the length of his run up (running windup/stretch). Given his short number of steps, the power he’s generating is incredible. When combined with the incredible movement off the bounce, he’s basically unhittable. Guys who pitch this fast have a longer delivery motion/time, giving the hitter more time to read his delivery, but Joseph has a smooth and compact delivery thrown after a short run up with a superbly deceptive release and the batsmen simply have no chance of being able to read the trajectory of a 90mph bouncing cutter, especially because of the horizontal motion after the bounce. The performance was utterly dominant— out of the 10 hitters on the team (who only bat once each) he eliminated 6 of them. A team might only get 6 guys out total so for one guy to do it, all while throwing unhittable fire all night and effectively throwing a shutout, (His final tally of 6 outs while allowing 12 runs on 28 “pitches” is a league record). 

His dominating arsenal and his still untapped upside make him a really exciting prospect! It’s always interesting to see athletes who advance their sport by inventing a new archetype of player. ",ergonomicjones,14,07-04-2019 06:52:07

If we wanna do some math getting 6/10 people out is like getting 16/27 strikeouts in baseball. But he only (by the rules of cricket you do 6 bowls and then someone else does 6 before you can potentially bowl again) bowled half the game.

I'm assuming getting 10 batsmen out and conceding no run would be a perfect game. For various reasons

1. You cannot bowl consecutive overs. An over is a set of six legal balls. After that, a different bowler bowls from the opposite side of the ground. How things generally work is that two bowlers bowl alternate overs (so say bowler X bowls from the north end, and bowler Y bowls from the south end), and when a new bowler is introduced from one end, it constitutes a bowling change. So, chances are that the other bowler would get batsmen out too, and therefore, you cannot get a 10-for. As a matter of fact, when Anil Kumble got 10 outs for 74 runs against Pakistan in 1999, when it appeared like the 10-for was on the cards, his good mate Javagal Srinath who was bowling from the other end, was deliberately bowling away from the stumps so that he doesn't get anyone out and allow Anil to get the 10-for.

2. Scoring one run is easy in cricket. It's no achievement. A school kid would be able to score one run against a star bowler. A batsman can say he had a good game when he scores 50 runs, or 100 runs or more, or wins his team the game and doesn't get out.",adxx12in,10,07-04-2019 07:22:32

&#x200B;

So, this tournament is 20 overs a side. 1 over is six legal balls bowled by the same guy (legal meaning not wide away from the batsman, or not crossing the line on the bowler's end when the bowler bowls, and for various reasons which will be in advanced cricket lessons and for this video's sake, irrelevant).

&#x200B;

Both the teams were on the same score at the end of their respective innings, and this called for a Super Over, which is in all essence, a 1 over a side game.

&#x200B;

The blue team scored 10 runs in their over, which meant the purple team needed 11 to win the game.

&#x200B;

Russell has been in devastating form of late. Probably the best power-hitter right now, even his mishits go out of the park. Rabada, who was designated to bowl for the blue team had to get it perfectly on target at his toes in order to prevent Russell from scoring or to get him out. With the pressure of a game in an important tournament with capacity crowds and the fact that there's the toughest batter to bowl to on the other end, the pressure was immense.

IDK much about baseball but it looks like Baseball is much more fair towards the Bowlers(or ""Pitchers""). Batsmen are forced to run whenever they hit the ball and they aren't allowed to leave the balls either or they're striked out.

Once I finally learned what an [Over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)) is, things started to make sense. Here's my explanation (keeping in mind, it's hard to understand without actually watching):

There's a big circular field with a rope or some other barrier defining the edge. In the middle, there is a smaller rectangle with two ends. On each end, there is a wicket, which is three stumps stuck in the ground connected by two bails.

There are two teams of 11 players with one team batting and the other fielding. The batting team has two players on the field--one who is up to bat and the other who is basically on the other base. There's a safe area in front of the two wickets where the offensive players can stand. The fielders are set up in all directions in the circle. They move for each batter based on the hitter's tendencies (think extremely sophisticated spray charts). One fielder is the ""bowler"" who throws the ball at the far wicket. The other fielder is the wicketkeeper who catches it.

The bowler tries to throw the ball so that it gets past the batter and hits the wicket. The bowler is allowed to bounce the ball once. The batter is trying to not get out by hitting the ball. If the batter misses and the ball hits the wicket, the batter is out. (One strike and you're out.) If the batter makes contact and the ball is caught on the fly by any of the 11 fielders, the batter is out.

If the batter makes contact and hits the ball in any direction (360-degrees) and it lands, the batter is not out. The batter can choose to run or if the batter thinks that is too risky, the batter can stay put.  When the batter chooses to run, the other offensive player by the other wicket must run too. They run back and forth as many times as they can before the ball is returned. Each time they safely make it to the other base, they score a run. Batters are always the player facing the bowler, so if the players score one run so that the initial batter is on the other end, you'll end up changing batters. But if you score two runs (make it there and back), you stay up at bat. Either way, you stay on the field until you get out when you are replaced by a teammate.

If they hit the ball so it rolls over the barrier, it is worth 4 runs automatically. If they hit it so it flies over the barrier, it is worth 6 runs automatically. The fielding team can try to get the batter out while he's running. If either runner is not back in the safe area in front of the wicket, the fielding team can throw the ball at the wicket and knock off the bails. Alternatively, they can throw the ball to a fielder who knocks it off. From my limited experience, most outs are caused by fly balls and pop-ups. When a batter is out, he is out for the inning. An inning is 10-outs long. Basically, you need to be able to have one batter and one runner.

One last major rule: when the bowler throws six legal throws, you switch to a new bowler and you switch sides of the field. So the other bowler will pitch to (likely) a different batter. After six more throws, you switch to another bowler, who can be the first bowler. The new bowler has to be a player on the field (you can't bring someone in from the bullpen) and anyone on the field can be the bowler (but generally bowlers are specialists). I say legal pitches because if the bowler bowls something completely unhittable, it's called a ""Wide"" and that scores an automatic run. You're also punished if you step over the line when bowling.

The most basic form of Cricket is Test Cricket. This lasts ~~four~~  two innings of 10 outs (so ~~40~~ 20 per side). This can last for five days with stoppages for tea. When tournaments started happening, they created ""Limited Overs Cricket."" Basically, instead of deciding the game by the number outs, it was done by the number of Overs (so essentially pitches). One-Day Cricket is 50 Overs, so 300 legal pitches per side. The game lasts one inning (maybe about five hours). Finally, there's T20 Cricket, which gives each team 20 Overs. That lasts about three hours.

They score a lot of runs in Cricket. I've only ever watched Limited Overs and I couldn't begin to tell you what Test Cricket feels like. Limited Overs Cricket is heavily focused on the offense. You're trying to score as many runs against as few pitches as possible. [Australia just beat Pakistan 327-307](https://www.google.com/search?q=t20+cricket&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS780US780&oq=T20+c&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i60l2j0l2.1007j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11fjxf1px5;5;/m/021q23;cms;fp;1;;) in 50-overs Cricket. An Out is bad, but it's more because your best hitters are near the top of the lineup and that means you're done for the day.

Onto this video, the bowler nailing the wicket like this is always awesome. The batter looks like he really had no chance.",pgm123,257,02-04-2019 15:22:38

Get rid of 1st and 3rd base, and always have a runner on second. You don't have to run on a hit ball, but if you get home, you can run back to second while the dude on second comes back home for another run. Whoever winds up at home hits next. If you ever let a perfect strike past you (as measured by it knocking over the little wooden tower thingy), you're out. In traditional (Test) cricket, everyone bats in an inning, until they get out. This means you hit super defensively - essentially fouling a ball off is always a good result, because letting any pitch past you is awful. This is also why it takes so long, because the strategic play is very slow.

It's four innings total, so 20 'outs' per side. 

That said, it's a good write up. I assume it draws a lot of analogies with baseball? 

The only other thing I'd say is that if your team is batting first, you're trying to score as many runs as possible, and you continue until you're out of 'outs' or out of overs. If you're batting second, you're simply trying to score more runs than the previous team did. The game is over when you've scored more runs than them, ran out of 'outs', or ran out of overs.

Also, test cricket is great.

Also, if the wicket keeper doesn't have his helmet on, and you hit the ball into his helmet with your bat, it's worth 5 runs. Cricket is weird. ",equationevasion,4,02-04-2019 16:45:17

So no team is ever really leading the game until it's over. A team can put up 220 runs thinking they did well then give up 221. ",olderaccount,3,02-04-2019 17:22:08

In some forms of the game it is considered perfect technique to block the ball when it's on target, leave it if it's not and only try to score of the bad balls. You will often see batsman face well over 200 balls without being out - quite different from baseball.

So a batter can technically stand where ever they want to but with the size of the pitch and the speed of the delivery.  Most stand side on with the bat in front of the stumps ( the three wooden sticks).  As if they get hit.  They lose their wicket ( 10 wickets 11 batsmen they always need 2 on the field.  You can't bat multiple times). 

The position they stand in is about half a meter in front of the stumps to allow backswing so they don't hit them themselves.  But allow for enough time to react to the bowled ball",PrinceBarin,1,02-04-2019 17:54:42

The bowler hits the batsman on the shoulder. The batsman shows no anger toward the bowler despite being very hurt. Literally the next delivery, he hits him on the hand. The crowd gets excited by the almost-dismissal. The commentator marvels at the quality of the cricket on display. The second delivery was definitely a response to the batsman being rattled by the first ball. Again, the batsman is not angry

This performance by the batsman, Michael Clarke, is in fact considered one of the great test knocks in recent times: https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/17/michael-clarke-fractured-shoulder-south-africa

Do cricket bowlers suffer from the same type of arm injuries as baseball pitchers?,Im sure its been asked a million times before. Im in Europe watching an IPL game at a pub and was just wondering. ,dhshlmt,"Okay, Coles Notes, in baseball, you have four bases, in cricket you effectively have two, each one has a batter on them and to score runs, they swap places. A home run (Off the grass without a bounce) is worth six runs and an in-field home run is worth 4 (Off the grass with at least one bounce).

Instead of a starting pitcher and a bullpen, of the eleven players on the field, most can bowl in some capacity.  Bowlers must rotate every six pitches (6 pitches = an over) It doesn't matter the order but at the end of one over, a new pitcher must start the next. 

Just like in baseball, there are different styles of bowlers - some spin the ball so it moves on the bounce (it doesn't *have* to bounce but the change in pace and the effect the bounce has on the balls trajectory makes it harder for the batsman if it does), some bowl faster than others, screw with the pace or make the ball curve in the air.

The first team sets a total by batting until everyone's out. For the most part, you get out by getting caught or getting bowled (The ball hits the wickets - the three sticks behind the batter) but its also out if you stick your leg in front of the wickets so the ball can't hit them. 

Also, the white line in front of the wickets is called the crease, if you're outside of the crease and someone hits the wickets, you're out - much like getting tagged when you're off-base.

Once the first team is all out, the agreed-upon number of overs have all been bowled or they're comfortable with the number of runs they've set, the second team comes out and they try to beat that total.

That should be enough to get you started. There are different forms of cricket and the tactics vary a *lot* depending on the form, but that's not really worth getting into unless it really blows your hair back.",Nine-Foot-Banana,15,20-05-2017 00:26:03

HOWEVER:

1) this is based on the assumption that the sport as a whole would pull in the same amount of money with/without the cap. This reasoning is flawed. As others have said, the cap promotes parity. This expands overall interest since markets like St. Louis and Portland can compete with markets like Chicago and LA. 

2) this stuff is all collectively bargained. The players associations negotiate an agreement with the owners as to how revenue is divided. A free labor market also allows for unions to negotiate with management, and this is what's happening here.

"Cricket owners overpay for player at IPL auction, head coach looks on in defeat",,de0lvll,"Balls 1 and 4 were awful, 2 and 3 were average. Not what you expect from someone you're entrusting with the last over.

Bowling is made up of 2 basic aspects (apart from pace and spin) - line and length. Line is where the ball is going from left to right across the width pitch . Length is where the ball is going to bounce in terms of length of the pitch (from bottom to top, or the length of the pitch).

Bowling balls at this stage of the game that are full are bad. This means that the ball bounces close to the batsman (say 50cm before his toes as an example, but it's more of a range than a specific number). In terms of line, in this case because the batsman is right-handed, bowling to right of the stumps is bad because it's easier to hit the ball far from there.

The combination of both bad line and length are illustrated in balls 1 and 4. In balls 2 and 3, only the length was really bad, and even then, it still required good batting for them to be hit for six.",IWantAnAffliction,1,21-02-2017 11:55:19

Maybe if people just followed their local *team* in stead of the nearest *franchise*, there would actually be markets everywhere. 


Why would you not be interested in following your local heroes from Muskogee if you are from Muskogee? 


It seems that American pro sports operate out of some belief that ""it must be top tier to be worth anything"". 

Which baffles me, since you supposedly has such a sporting culture and all. 



Take a country like Germany. Bayern Munich is absolutely dominating the top tier of soccer with little competition, just like they have been for some 20 years. 


But that does not prevent 30.000 people from showing up and having a party when 3rd tier FC Erzgebirge Aue is playing 6th tier BSG Chemie Leipzig in the local Saxony cup.


Sport is about cheering for your (local) heroes - *not* about having a set of completely equal franchises where no one are allowed to be better than anyone else. 

 

Edit: don't get me wrong - I like competetiveness. But don't try to make this about ""markets"". Everything can be a market if your product is good enough. And in many countries, 3rd, 4th or even 5th tier sports (soccer) teams have a good enough product that that they are easily sustainable and can draw in several thousand people week after week. 

Any day of the week, I would prefer to go see a lower tier local rivalry than a match between two top tier clubs with no shared history. It is also a lot cheaper. Now you can get enterance + beers + sausages for $20 in stead of barely just the enterance.",,-40,20-02-2017 21:51:39

"Cricket owners overpay for player at IPL auction, head coach looks on in defeat",,de01dsq,"> Why would you not be interested in following your local heroes from Muskogee if you are from Muskogee?

Why WOULD I be interesting in following low level sports simply b/c it is near by? If i don't find it entertaining it being close to my house does not alter that fact. The players on not ""local heroes"" they are soccer players...that is it. They are not heroes. And if they are 4th their players not particularly amazing ones at that. 

Because it is much more entertaining watching the best players in the world compete against the other best players. Watching Messi or Ronaldo is much more entertaining that watching John from down the street against a bunch of other people I don't know, that have a fraction of the talent of Messi. I don't just blindly support someone simply b/c they are local. Which leads to this

> It seems that American pro sports operate out of some belief that ""it must be top tier to be worth anything"".

Because quality > proximity. I would happily go to Bayern Munich because they are very good, they are entertaining to watch. I wouldn't go to watch Chemi Leipzig because they are not. The end.




> Everything can be a market if your product is good enough.

Sure...and for me 3rd, 4th, or 5th level sports are not ""good enough"". They are not exciting enough, they are not good enough, they are not talented enough. Just because something is local doesn't magically make it good. 

> Which baffles me, since you supposedly has such a sporting culture and all.


It baffles you because you clearly have no idea the variety and popularity of a variety of sports in the US. 

In Germany soccer is king...the end. Nothing comes close to competing withe soccer. The closest from monetary standpoint is ice hockey and it isn't even close. Bayern Munich has a salary budget for players at $191 million. For pro-hockey in Germany the top is $5 million. 

So 3rd or 4th teir soccer teams can have success b/c even they are more valuable and popular than even the best hockey team. FC Erzgebirge Aue player values are  $11 million, more than double the best hockey team.

There is a reason there are not major & popular 2nd or 3rd tier hockey teams. 



In the US there is no one single sport that is that dominant. American Football is the most popular but hockey, basketball, baseball, and even college football are no slouches either. You would not have a 2nd or 3rd string american football team beating out a pro-basketball team. A 2nd or 3rd tier product is simply not ""good enough"" to compete with 4 other tier 1 sports. 

So in the end the Germany sports market is basically has 1 top level sport. Soccer and more soccer. In the US you have 5 Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey, and College Football. 


> Sport is about cheering for your (local) heroes - not about having a set of completely equal franchises where no one are allowed to be better than anyone else.

No sports is about cheering and being entertained by players competing against the other players. The better those players are the more entertaining it is. They are not heroes and I don't care where they came from.

No.  That is not the reason that IPL contracts are smaller than NFL contracts.  The reason that IPL contracts are smaller than NFL contract is that the IPL, despite being the richest domestic cricket league in the biggest market, receives a tiny fraction of the TV revenue of the NFL.

The contracts are not negotiated on the basis of the players' opportunity to play elsewhere when not committed to their IPL team.  The amounts negotiated are a product of the demand for the player and the supply of cash.  Whether or not that player is able to play elsewhere may be something that management raises in negotiations but ultimately the free market prevails: how much would I pay to this person in light of the financial or other success I estimate they will generate for me.",,0,21-02-2017 01:19:02

>They filmed opposing coaches' signals from an illegal area. Bellicheck had been doing this since he started coaching. 

First off, everyone was stealing other coaches signals for quite some time, Belichick is nothing special in this regard. For proof here's a quote from Bill Cowher who coached the Steelers from 1992-2006:

 “We didn’t lose the game because of any 'Spygate,' because of them having any additional things. [If] they’re guilty of anything they’re guilty of arrogance because they were told not to do something but it was something everybody does. They got caught doing it with a camera. Stealing someone’s signals was a part of the game and everybody attempted to do that. We had people that always tried to steal signals."" 

The only reason why they got punished for this was because a memo went out to all teams saying ""you can't film from this spot anymore. Push it back 20ft and you're good"" However, Bill was under the impression that the Rules Committee was the one that made the rules so he disregarded the memo; a mistake in hindsight.

1. A hat-trick in cricket (3 deliveries, 3 wickets) is up with there with the perfect game in baseball. It's one of THOSE moments.
2. That particular hat-trick was 3 wickets in 2 balls, which is where we get to the rules--the first ball was a wide, which means that it's too far from the batsman to hit, so it's not counted as a ""legal"" delivery (and an extra delivery is added in to the standard ""over"" which is, normally, six balls) except in some very specific circumstances: for example, being stumped (which is what happened there).
3. So, you just watched the technically (almost) impossible--2 legal deliveries, 3 wickets.

When I sent them the questions I didn't now what I'd get back. And I guess -- from what I know about the sport-- it should have come as no surprise that their response was over 5 pages long! Here's a wonderfully in-depth look into what you'll find on /r/cricket.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

##Batting:

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

##Batting:

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless.

##Bowling:

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

* More info on upcoming fixtures [can be found here.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/current/match/fixtures_futures.html)

When I sent them the questions I didn't now what I'd get back. And I guess -- from what I know about the sport-- it should have come as no surprise that their response was over 5 pages long! Here's a wonderfully in-depth look into what you'll find on /r/cricket.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.

##Batting:

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

##Batting:

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

",cep8pbl,"Yeah, pretty much. To clear up a few points:

The pitch (playing surface) is in the middle of the oval and the batsmen can hit the ball in any direction (even [directly behind them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6i1AlJi36M)), and most catches are probably taken behind the batsman off a nick or an edge, so there's no 'wasted space'.

Two batsmen are on the field at once, with one 'on strike' and the other standing at the bowler's end. When the ball is hit they score runs (which go onto the total of the batsman who was on strike) by running between the two ends. Whoever is left at the end opposite the bowler is on strike for the next delivery. Every six balls (called an 'over') the fielding side swap around and bowl from the opposite end. And they keep doing that until one of them gets out and is replaced by the next batsman.

The wickets are those wooden things sticking out of the ground. The vertical poles are called stumps and the things balancing on top are called bails, but the whole thing is usually just called 'the stumps' and 'wicket' more commonly refers to an out (as in ""he took 4 wickets"") or the pitch for some reason (""a grassy wicket"").

To get a batsman out, the bowler can hit the stumps ('bowled') or the batsman's body if the ball was going to hit the stumps, as judged by the umpire, ('leg before wicket'). While the batsmen are running, if a fielder knocks the bails off the stumps by throwing the ball, or with the hand they are holding the ball in the batsman is 'run out'. If any part of their body or bat (they run with the bat) is touching the ground behind the crease (that line in front of the stumps) then they are safe.

It is only a 'duck' if the batsman gets out without scoring any runs (0 - a duck egg) and any time an umpire's decision is required the fielding team must 'appeal', that is ask the umpire whether the batsman is out (typically ""how's that?""). If they don't appeal, and the batsman doesn't 'walk' of their own volition then they are not out. (That crowd sign is calling Stuart Broad a cheat for not walking when the umpire made a bad decision. Cook and Root are other English players, and 'root' is Australian for 'shag').

There are 11 players per side. When 10 of them get out (because the guy left in has no partner to bat with), the other team bats. Each team bats twice in a test match and once in limited overs matches.",volabimus,5,14-01-2014 13:17:30

When I sent them the questions I didn't now what I'd get back. And I guess -- from what I know about the sport-- it should have come as no surprise that their response was over 5 pages long! Here's a wonderfully in-depth look into what you'll find on /r/cricket.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

* More info on upcoming fixtures [can be found here.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/current/match/fixtures_futures.html)

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

* More info on upcoming fixtures [can be found here.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/current/match/fixtures_futures.html)

",ceq1rpc,"Haha LBW will wrinkle some brains.

If the batsman is trying to play a shot the ball must hit him in line with the stumps and be going on to hit the stumps. The ball must also not bounce outside leg stump (the opposite side to the 'strikezone').

When I sent them the questions I didn't now what I'd get back. And I guess -- from what I know about the sport-- it should have come as no surprise that their response was over 5 pages long! Here's a wonderfully in-depth look into what you'll find on /r/cricket.

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

###Tell us about the game of cricket.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding.

Cricket is arguably (depending on the statistic and source) the second/third most popular sport in the world. It originated in England in the 1500s and is played between two teams of 11 players. As a result of its heritage it is most popular in countries that are either current or former territories of the British Empire. 

All forms of cricket are played by having each team take one or more turns at batting (an innings). 2 batsmen play at a time and attempt to score runs by hitting the ball anywhere on the field (the further the better usually). 

The opposing team fields and bowls 6-ball overs at the batting team attempting to get the batsmen out. When 10 batsmen are out the innings is over. The team with the most runs at the end of the match is the winner.

There are three main forms of cricket with decreasing levels of complexity: 

* Tests: Played over 5 days, each team has 2 batting innings each. In a great match the fortunes of the teams will change each day. Bowlers might rule on cool, overcast mornings and then a batsman might dominate in the sun after lunch. The character of the game changes as the ball becomes more worn, as the weather changes and as, over the course of 5 days, the pitch becomes more and more worn out. 

* One Day Games: Played in 1 day, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 50 overs each. Shorter and usually featuring more aggressive play than test cricket.

* Twenty20 Games: Played in about 3 hours, each team has 1 innings and a maximum of 20 overs each. The most aggressive format packed full of big shots and acrobatic fielding.


###What can new fans do to learn more about cricket?

Cricket can be complex and daunting for those new to the sport because of the variety of rules, unique terminology, and time investment of some formats but it is also very rewarding and entertaining once you get an understanding. 

Twenty20 is by far the easiest format to follow for beginners, while test cricket is generally the most complex and traditional form of the game.

Cricket is most similar in format to baseball, and [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cricket_and_baseball) may be useful to anyone familiar with baseball attempting to follow cricket for the first time.

There are also a variety of links on the r/cricket [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/faq) that may be useful in providing more information. Otherwise, just drop by the sub and say hi. Dropping by during a popular match would be helpful, as the community can help explain what's going on.

There are a few flash games out there that can be addicting and help you learn the rules ([Stick Cricket](http://www.sticksports.com/game/stick-cricket/classic/) and [Pocket Cricket](http://www.pocketcricket.net/) are two of the more popular ones).

[This introduction to cricket video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Aea0BR26k) may also be helpful. [Cricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) is pretty much the home of cricket on the net too.

###What are some /r/cricket events or features?

* Regular match threads (we have a bot /u/rCricketBot that creates these automatically for international matches)

* Periodic sledge threads (aka trash talk) - created by users

* /u/howstat: stats bot created by a subscriber that can be used to dig up career stats (with a variety of modifiers) for players in comment threads

* All the typical flair options you'd expect in a sports sub

* Revolving sidebar pic updated by mods to highlight top news stories

* We have the odd AMA (pretty rare at this stage though). [Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1rn5hi/ama_time/) being the most notable to date.

* Annual bestof awards and community awards (voting for the community's favourite matches/performances of the year)


A couple of things that were running last year but are not at the moment (hopefully to be revived again in future):

* /r/sniffingleather: a cricket-themed podcast started and run by members of the community

* /r/redditcommentates: an online audio commentary stream for popular matches, featuring volunteer redditors from around the globe acting as amateur commentators for the game.


###What is the best play you've ever seen?

Rather than nominate our own individual favourites, these are some great highlights of each cricketing discipline.

##Batting:

* [Corey Anderson scores the fastest one-day century ever.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPVb_OS0Gc) 100 runs off 36 balls.

* [Sachin Tendulkar hits Andrew Caddick for 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9E81QkbLs) out of the ground. A magnificent piece of timing to make it look effortless. 

* [Yuvraj Singh hits 6 consecutive sixes in an over.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIz9jNAEGw) This was only the second time this has happened at international level.

* [David Warner plays a switch-hit shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dojDT4CtenU) While controversial, this high-risk tactic is technically legal.


##Bowling:

* [Ryan Harris bowling Alastair Cook first ball.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThoughtfulEcstaticBallpython) This delivery first swings in to the batsmen in the air before moving away from him after bouncing. [And another view](http://gfycat.com/RadiantIllIndigobunting).

* [Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling in the recent Ashes series (at up to 153 km/h or 95 mph).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CMFxm5rhk) Aggressive bowling at the batsman is a legitimate tactic (within reason).

* [Dale Steyn destroying Pakistan with quality swing bowling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoszJ1K666Y) Steyn bowled 49 balls in this innings of which only 3 were scored off.

* [Shane Warne huge spinning delivery.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jQ0fRvFR0&t=25s) This video also contains footage of what is known as 'the ball of the century'.


##Fielding:

* [Paul Collingwood catch, England v Australia](http://i.minus.com/ixnifFtObblHh.gif)

* [All New Zealand fielders crowd the English batsman at the end of one of the games of the year.](http://i.imgur.com/m48S3wL.jpg) New Zealand needed just one wicket (out) to win but only had 6 balls left to do it.

* [Trent Boult catch, New Zealand v West Indies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUS5ZmMBsM)

* [AB de Villiers runs out Simon Katich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPVB4WP5hk)


###What is your favorite cricket tradition?

* My favourite cricket tradition is The Ashes. The Ashes is the name given to test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name started in 1882, after Australia beat England in England for the first time. A satirical obituary was published in a British newspaper stating that English cricket had died, ""and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia"". The Ashes is one of the busiest periods on /r/cricket. - /u/jack47 

* My favourite tradition is lunch and tea. It's the cricket tradition that makes for a lot of head scratching amongst people not familiar with the sport, but really it's only a logical extension of the length of the day's play. With 3 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each it would be pretty inhumane to make players go without food. - /u/TheAshes 

* [People dressing up to go to the cricket.](http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/183v4g/in_australia_we_dress_up_to_go_to_the_cricket/) A somewhat modern tradition that has started taking off around the world. - /u/rreyv

* For me (in Australia) it's the traditional cricket matches on Boxing Day and Australia Day. Summer just wouldn't be complete without them. The Boxing Day Test in particular is something special in Australia - in 2013 over 91,000 people (including myself) attended the first day's play. The atmosphere at that time of year is unbelievable. - /u/Eyesallonfire

* [The Guard of Honor at the last game of a great player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoLyeAdS0Y) The opposing fielding team will usually give a retiring legend a guard of honor when he walks up to bat for his final game, out of respect for the player's contribution to the game. - /u/sunnydelish


###What events are coming up in cricket leagues?

* The Australian domestic T20 [Big Bash League](http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2013/content/current/series/641477.html) is currently being played and is probably the most 'newbie friendly' cricket to watch right now (there's a match on most days).

* Also at the moment, [New Zealand are touring the West Indies](http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-west-indies-2013-14/content/current/series/661629.html) and [Sri Lanka are playing Pakistan.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-sri-lanka-2013-14/content/current/series/657625.html)

* The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest/most popular annual Twenty20 tournament in the world and will begin in April.

* Next year cricket's biggest tournament the 4-yearly One Day International World Cup will take place in Australia/New Zealand.

* More info on upcoming fixtures [can be found here.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/current/match/fixtures_futures.html)
