"AITAH for ""robbing"" my wife's affair partner which has now lead to his divorce?","I (32) have been married to my soon to be ex-wife (30), Madison, for four years. We are currently in counseling but it is not going to work.

About a year ago I found out she was having an affair by coming home to their clothes in our living room and sounds coming from our bedroom.

I lost it. I was getting my cricket bat out of the front closet when I stopped to think about consequences. I did not want to go to jail.

Instead I took all their clothes and left quietly. I went to a friend's house but not before throwing all the clothes in a McDonald's garbage can.

I turned off my phone and got shitfaced with my buddy. His wife hosed us off in the morning.

After I turned my phone back on I had dozens of calls and texts from Madison. First scared because she got my updated flight information. Then upset that I hadn't called her to let her know I was going to be coming home early. Then freaked out that the house had been broken into. Then crazy because she figured out it was me. They just got more deranged.

The guy she was with is five inches shorter than me and about 60 pounds lighter. So if he had taken my clothes it would be obvious.

He ended up calling his friend to go get his spare keys from his house. Unfortunately for him his wife smelled a rat and followed his friend back to my house. Where she saw him leaving in oversized clothes.

Long story short she took pictures and she had evidence of his infidelity. Which caused their prenup to be cancelled. Which cost him a lot of money. It is all one big giant shit show.

It took a couple of months but my wife convinced me to try and forgive her. We started going to counseling and we were working our way through it. Until recently.

In a counseling session she said that I was wrong to steal his wallet, phone, and car keys. She said that his divorce is costing him a lot of money and that I should have dealt with it in a more mature manner and that it was my fault.

I have never admitted to taking his stuff. To begin with I was afraid he might call the cops. Then I didn't want to give her ammunition in case she wanted a divorce. Now I just don't care.

I told her that her cheating was the reason her boyfriend is getting divorced. And that I hope his ex takes everything.

I am still not living at home. I have my own apartment and I'm filing for divorce. Now that I know how she feels it is kind of a slap in the face that she is blaming me for his divorce.",ResearchIll9654,2024-04-22,35515,AITAH
I Killed My Bearded Dragon,"I got Pancake from a guy i knew in high school. She was very unhealthy, likely very inbred since she was from a petco, as well as i believe she was UV deficient during developmental years. I did my best with her and I managed to get her to a healthy state, but she always had issues with her digestion. I got her at the age of 2 and she just died today around 6 or 7. She’s the only reptile i’ve ever owned, and I believe I did the best I could. Regular baths, lots of healthy greens with some fruit, crickets for protein. 

She had a  visit to the vet about a year ago and they said she was perfectly healthy. The only thing I can think of is that I over fed her crickets and she became impacted. I knew about this condition, but I had always avoided it with regular massages and doing my best to balance her diet. However this last time I bought her large crickets instead of medium without thinking about it. That was my mistake. The exoskeletons were too much for her to pass and she died in the middle of the night. Was happy as a clam yesterday. Ran around the room with my girlfriend and I appearing to be healthy. I noticed she couldn’t poop yesterday, but that’s always been an issue for her so I didn’t think twice. 

I assumed she’d pass it the next day. I was wrong and had I simply massaged the bolus and broken it apart, i suspect she’d still be alive. I can make all the excuses I want like I didn’t know any better and I’ve never owned a reptile before, but I still feel like shit because she died of a preventable cause due to my lack of recognition of a serious medical emergency.

Sorry for the tangent but I suppose it’s somewhat cathartic to talk about it online. I loved her and I will always love my bearded dragon Pancake. I’d like to think she lived a better life than she was before and that she was happy, but it’s a shame she had to fall into the hands of a dumbass like me. Rest in peace my little girl.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ze494/ex_42f_is_creating_so_much_drama_in_my37m_life/)**: August 24, 2016**

I don't know where to begin. I was married for 13 years. Have 2 mall children 4 and 6. And after being divorced I am now remarried to a wonderful woman (Donna).

My ex will not stop harassing me. I have to communicate with her for the kids. But it is so contentious that the court finally ordered all communication go through an online site, and I had to change my phone number and move. It was that bad.

I had my kids this weekend. Things went great and I went and saw my family. No incidents, we had a great time. Then I got this email

***Email:***

Jill and Marvin \[kids\] report that they were in a traffic accident with you this weekend, in the truck.

They both report that the loud, obscene exchange between their father and the ABC Towing driver scared them.

They both report that they were bitten by Greg's dog, Murphy, during their visit at your folks house this weekend.

This is the second dog they have both reported biting them. I have also posted their reports that they have been bitten by a large dog named Betsy, at your in-laws house.

They have traumatic memories of metal being scraped out of your leg. I hope that you recover \&amp; get back to your job quickly. I hope that Donna is okay. They report that you have trouble walking. This is consistent with behavior I observed at Drop-Off on Sunday night; you didn't get out of your new car, and it appeared very awkward for you to unbuckle their booster seat belts from the driver's seat..

I need to know about these things, please!

Dog bites are notoriously dirty and prone to infections.

Just because our children didn't appear to be as seriously injured as you were in the truck accident, doesn't mean that they couldn't be stiff and sore and possibly have internal injuries for which I need to be observing. At least I need to understand why they were stiff and sore and acting more fearful than usual when they came home.

Their mild to moderate bruising and scrapes, and the chunks of skin missing from their hands and fingers, are consistent with their reports of the accident and the dog bites.

I will take Jill and Marvin to the pediatrician walk-in clinic to rule out any unseen injuries and infections. It would be nice if you would call or email the doctor's office, and tell them what you can about the accident and the dog bites. It could help rule out tests and treatments that might not be necessary. It would also be nice if you would pay your half of their medical expenses; especially because the accident and the dog bites happened when they were with you.

Today is Jill's first day of school. I could have taken them to the doctor 2 days ago, if you had shared that they were bitten and in a traffic accident that was bad enough required a tow truck for the truck, and medical care for you.

If you want to drive the kids to Santa Barbara and back in a weekend, expose them to animals that aren't safe for children, and fight with tow truck drivers in front of them, I cannot prevent that. But what happens to their little, growing bodies, and the events that are being imprinted on their sweet, innocent minds, is very much my business.

Please share all of the information regarding what happened to our children in the truck accident. Please share all of the information regarding the bites from the dogs.

As a mother, it is very worrisome to hear my preschooler and my first grader recount the dangerous things that are happening to them; but it is even more worrisome that my Co-Parent withholds vital information about their health.

Jill and Marvin deserve to know that their parents are working together to take care of them.

Thank you.

***Rest of the post:***

I don't even know where to begin. The dog that was there had no teeth.... Didn't bite them.... And couldn't have even if it wanted to. My in laws dog is dead. I was never in an accident. There was no tow truck. All of this is false. I can't even find a shred of a real event that could have gotten twisted.

This comes on the heels of 4 days ago, her trying to corner me into signing away 30% of my custody agreement, and refusing to let me even look at the details of the paperwork.

I am so frazzled by all of this that, at times, I think about signing away my Parental rights just to not have the stress. But I don't want my children thinking I don't care for them and abandoned them.

How do you reason with this level of Crazy?

Any advice is welcome. I need help managing this

Tl;dr trying to deal with a crazy ex, and barely holding it together for the sake of the kids.

***Relevant Comments (from legal advice and relationships):***

Commenter: Why are you so cowed by your ex wife that her telling you to sign something you don't want to sign causes you stress? It shouldn't be that hard to say no.

>**OOP:** That is a brief snapshot... When it's every day, or every other day... It gets stressful. I never know what accusation is going to be lobbed at me next.

*When they divorced:*

>2 years ago

*To a deleted comment:*

>Yeah. I already spent almost all of my savings to get the custody agreement I have. Dropping another 20k would be tough. To pay for I'd have to pick up another job, which would then not allow me to access the custody I am wanting

Commenter: Turn this over to your lawyer.

Please fight this fight. I know it is hard but can you imagine growing up with a mother who chooses to rewrite history and reality to suit her whims?

>**OOP:** Lawyers have been contacted. No response in 3 days, emailed with this craziness this morning. Still crickets...

Commenter: ""Their mild to moderate bruising and scrapes, and the chunks of skin missing from their hands and fingers, are consistent with their reports of the accident and the dog bites.""

So do these things not exist or what?

>**OOP:** I didn't see any thing... A scrape on the foot from the flip flop one was wearing but other than that. Nothing

Commenter: How does Donna feel about all of this?

>**OOP:** Pissed.... It is a major source of conflict in our marriage. Actually it is just about the only thing we ever argue about.

**Tangential** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lfqi6/legal_rights_surrounding_a_primary_custody_parent/)**: January 1, 2017 (4+ months later)**

**Title:** Legal rights surrounding a primary custody parent who after 4 attempts is not picking up her children from me (the non custodial parent) \[CA\]

I am in Southern California. I don't know what to to here. I am the non custodial parent. I have had the kids for 1 week (4 and 6) during Christmas break. Due to the high conflict nature of my ex we have been assigned a co-parenting person to help mediate. On the 30th we were supposed to exchange the kids back to her care. I showed up 15 min early to the location, and we waited for 1 HR and 7 min before giving up and leaving. She had been claiming she was right there for over 35 min. (The location was an IHOP, 300 ft from the freeway exit)

After I left I got a slew of messages calling me all sorts of names, and claiming that she had just showed up, but that I had left. (This song and dance has happened before) she said she would meet me anywhere, just to let her know where. This time I called her bluff and picked a location 2 miles from my home, and told her, the kids are hungry and tired of waiting. I'm taking them to my house, when you arrive at the location (11 miles from the IHOP) text me and let me know, and I'll bring them right over. I sent her the location 5 times in text and twice via email. 4.5 hours later. Nothing

I then told her that we could meet at the agreed upon location at 11 am the next nay for the exchange, just 1 day later than planned. When I woke up I the morning she demanded I drive them 1 hour to a new location, because she had a 103 degree fever and couldn't drive. There of course was a back and forth about her ability to care for children if she was too sick to drive. Ultimately she failed to arrive at the location at 11am

At 5pm I got a doctors note stating that she only had a cold as was fine to care for the children (I didn't ask for this).

I then called her and we had a heated back and forth, but ultimately I relented and told her that I would bring them to a location that she chose. 1 hour away and 1 mile from her house. Under the agreement that she would show up this time. Before leaving I sent an email confirming the location and time. That was sent at 7:48pm. We arrived at the location and 8:51pm and texted to let her know we were there.

What happened next was so frustrating. No response to any text was ever given. Every time I would send a text, I would get an email. All of them stating the same thing. That she would not leave her house until I verified my location. I sent her 6 different responses to emails telling her where I was. All I would get in response is more messages asking me to confirm my location. I even made a phone call telling her where I was.... Unfortunately at this point I was in such disbelief I did yell at her and tell her to get her ass down here. (Not my finest hour)

At 10:21pm. With kids in high anxiety and crying that their mom had forgotten them again, we left and drove the hour back home.

I have now messages accusing me of child abduction.

I don't know what to do... I am not subjecting my kids to this again. I can't bear to watch them check every car, and get excited ""I think I see her!"" over and over again for hours while she plays these games.

My worry is that the cops are going to come knock down my door.... When I have done everything I can to make these exchanges work.

Is this enough to have my lawyers file an emergency hearing to get primary custody?

I am in limbo right now since neither my lawyers or the coparenting person will be in the office until the 3rd.

Tl;dr mother has missed 4 exchanges in 2 days. What are my legal rights in this situation?

***Relevant Comments;***

Commenter: Why can't you just drop the kids off at her house if she's ""not feeling well enough to drive""? It sounds like she's playing games and you're letting her.

>**OOP**: She has told me over and over again not to come to her house, under any circumstance.

Commenter: Was the mediator alerted to this situation when it was occurring? If not, why not?

>**OOP:** She doesn't check her email or phone over the weekend

Commenter: Keep the kids, stop dealing with her shit and file for full emergency custody this week.

>**OOP:** She is now stating that she is 5 miles away, waiting for me to deliver the kids. This was not prearranged.

***Editor's note:*** *Thanks to mods for helping me recover this!*

**Title:** \[California\] Not sure what my options are with a crazy ex wife scenario. (literally)

I am in the process of a 730 evaluation for primary custody of my kids. Two kids 7 and 5 Today, was another doozy of an exchange...and I am fearful for the kids

I don't know what my options are here... if any

My Ex was 53 min late to the exchange today. at 4:24 she sent me a text stating she was exiting the freeway That is 2 miles from the meeting spot arranged in Co-parenting for today. she doesn't show up until 4:53

Exchange goes ok. But I know something is coming, because if she is ever in the wrong she has to lash out and blame someone else or invent a scenario where she is the victim.

I had to wait all of 4 min.

I got a text stating ""I just drove by your car, and the back seat was empty. where are the kids?""

I said ""Wasn't my car. I have two kids"" then knowing where this was going sent a picture of them in the car.

Response: ""when did you have time to take this? because I had plenty of time to look at the stoplight. You were alone. It's ok if Donna (my current wife) has them. It's totally legal, just weird to hide it.

I then called her. She answered. I said. Hi, she said Hi, and then I asked the kids to say Hi. I then asked the kids ""where are we at kids?""....at this point She started saying ""hello, hello? is there anyone there?

I then got a text ""Thank you for the phone call. But there was no sound

I responded. ""I am turning off my phone now. these accusations are bizarre""

I got back: ""Not as bizarre as pretending to pick up our kids. Just tell me who has them""

I called again. Immediately with the ""hello? hello?"" I knew for sure it was a game at this point. I just ended the call

She responded ""You can't just keep ending conversations because you don't want to deal with the facts."" ""If this turns into another 49 hour abduction like New Year's, I will definitely filing a report"" (Read the last post on that [incident here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lfqi6/legal_rights_surrounding_a_primary_custody_parent/)

This is next level insane. I am terrified for the kids. This is like raising to the level that she needs to be committed.

Thoughts apart from just continuing with the psych eval I already have going?

***Relevant Comment:***

**OOP:** We went back to family court. Court ordered a psych evaluation. That process is about 6 months. We are 1 month into that

Ok I want to give the timeline so people understand the full issue I am up against. Basically my children were hidden from me for 55 hours during my parenting time. Their location and the whole situation.... well I was lied to about the whole time

Been divorced 5 years. 30% custody exchange was to be dec 28 12pm for my half of Xmas break

Timeline Dec 26: 4pm get a picture of where they are spending Christmas (ex and 2 kids 9 and 7) showing large snow fall and a message saying they are not sure when the snow plows will start

Dec 27 12pm another picture and message stating same thing (except in the picture you can tell cars have left and come back from 1st picture

6pm: I tell her, if you get out tonight, I’ll come get the kids as planned (in court order) from your house (12pm dec 28th) if you do not get out until the morning do you want to just bring them by my house ( on the way from where she is coming from) —- I get a thumbs up to that message

8 pm. I ask if she got out. No response

Dec 28 9am: I ask for a status update so I know if I need to drive the hour to her house. No response

10:20 am I ask again for an update. No response

11am I leave to drive the hour for exchange, not knowing info.

12 pm. (Exchange time) arrive at house. Text that I have arrived. Her car is there. Her mom’s car is not (she lives with her mom) I video tape the time on the vehicle verbally notate the time and date. Show her car and the darkened house on the video tape ( I assume she has driven up with her mom to where she is snowed in)

12:10pm finally get a response saying they are still snowed in. No plows yet

4pm I offer that since my parents are driving down, and they have a large truck they could swing by and get the kids on their way to my house tomorrow. No response until the next day

Note: I check all roads in the area... all are showing being open, and flowing traffic. I even verify with live traffic cams form 1/2 mile from where she is that roads are cleared and cars are driving. (I have screen shots of this and the video is time stamped)

Dec 29th 8am She declines this and says “ we should stick to orders” she also tells me her internet is out

Dec 29th 11 am I contact the police about child abduction. I tell them the story. They say “here is an incident number, we are not going to open a case on this. Take it up with the court.”

4pm I get a message saying “ Freeways closing down for the night. Been driving every backroad looking for entrances without frozen bridges or backed up with accidents. It’s an hour wait every time I fill up. Everybody’s sure it’ll be better tomorrow. Signals are better at least.”

I respond asking her to tell me when she leaves

Note. No freeways or highways are shut down. I check all state and local websites to verify. Even check Twitter and local live camera feeds

Dec 30 8am call my lawyers. Tell them what is going on. Send them all of the timeline and they say they will reach out to her attorney

1pm. They finally get in touch with her attorney and the response back is that “she is leaving today, that she will message me when she does, and I can come and get the kids from her place”

2pm I ask for an update from my ex

4:45pm still having gotten no communication I call my lawyers again. They call her lawyer. I finally get a response. “I have left” That’s all

6pm get a message “I am home, you can come get them”

7pm 55 hours past exchange, I get the kids I ask them about the snow and being stuck. I was not trying to pry information or grill them, just casual light conversation

They tell me that they have been at home for 3 days. Since the night of the 27th!

Now I am asking some more pointed questions. I ask about what car they drove (they are kids, maybe the time line is wrong) they say they were in their mom’s car because grandma had to leave on Christmas Day to be back home, so they drove separately. They say that mom said I told her she could keep them for 2 more days.

I am furious. It was all lies.

I am contacting lawyers today. But what are my options here? I want to have a reasonable expectation walking into this. My stance right now is, I need action and need someone else to be as posed about this as I am, or I’ll find a lawyer who is. But I do realize my emotions are elevated

Additional note: In the last 2 years I have filed a 730. Spent 12k on it. 2 year process. Basically it said I am the better parent, but that she might be improving, and that his suggestion would be to wait a year and do another 730 and if things haven’t improved by then, it would be appropriate to swap me to primary custody. That report was produced in April this year

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1emkiqh/update_ex_42f_is_creating_so_much_drama_in_my37m/)**: August 7, 2024 (8 years from OG post, 4.5 from last update)**

I was looking in my profile and saw my post in this subreddit from 7 years ago, as my Ex was causing so much chaos that I was doubting everything. That post is linked here [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/ScafVaff3L](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/ScafVaff3L) *\[editor's note- OOP has an extensive reddit history going back over a decade\]*

I took everything to heart and implemented several things right away. I became a grey rock… and started documenting my ass off. I consulted my lawyers, and they said they advised several steps. The first of which was a 730 evaluation. (This is an evaluation done by a psychologist) that process took a really long time as the 730 evaluator got very sick halfway through. That took 10 months. At the end the report essentially read “Mom is volatile and disorganized and that dad’s home would be a more stable home for the children. However, there is hope that mom is starting to improve, so if things are still bad in 1 year it would be appropriate to change custody to dad”

This was a tough pill to swallow. Things were not better, and the chaos was just intermittent. So we just kept documenting, and doing our thing. Eventually, we started getting a lot of emails from teachers that Jill in particular, was often not bathed, never had her homework done, didn’t have school supplies and that she was falling way behind in her studies. We applied for a trial to review custody, and asked for primary custody to be swapped to us. That was at the end of 2019, and trial was set for May 2020.

So as you can imagine, once COVID hit, everything got delayed. There was a large amount of events in 2020. COVID shut down. Donna and I had a child, Rebecca. And then my Ex started denying visitation to Jill and Marvin. Every 2 weeks I would go down… wait in front of the house. No kids would emerge. Sometimes I would have the police come, not to force anything, but to get the documentation in terms of a case number. This went on for 4 months, before I was able to start getting visitation again.

Eventually, the trial was set for summer of 2021 and went for 3 days and I had over 500 pages of documentation. Day 1 was entirely testimony from the Co-Parenting therapist we had been seeing for 5 years. She testified that my Ex was the most difficult client she had ever worked with in her career, that my ex never followed a single agreement in session, and that she was a pathological liar.

Last day of testimony was my ex, where she was caught lying on the stand, and was presented with evidence that she had been secretly taking the children to a medical professional for 2 years that I had explicitly not agreed to.

So starting in Aug 2021, the judge ordered the kids come live with me, primary custody and limiting my ex to 4 days a month.

It’s now been 3 years: When Jill was in 5th grade she had a 26% in math, and a 40% in English. For the last 3 years, she has maintained a 4.0 every single year, and will be starting High School in Honors Geometry, Honors English and AP Biology.

Marvin has also been doing well also and just finished his first year of middle school with a 4.0 GPA, and is loving his coding and robotics elective.

They have new clothes, and have learned new skills and responsibilities. Donna has been crucial in setting up patterns to help with success in school. Their rooms are both immaculate, and they are the ones doing it with very little direction from us. They are happy and finally involved in activities and sports.

Our little Rebecca adores them both, and I will often find all 3 of them cuddled up together as one of the older two reads a book to her.

Jill made the decision recently to stop going on visits to her mom. The chaos and drama started being directed at her… along with lack of food, clothes that fit, etc. Marvin is still going for visits and we are encouraging that as long as he is feeling safe there.

All in all things are going so well and the kids are doing incredible. There are hard moments still, but it has all been worth it, and we are able to shield them for the most part from any chaos their mom may want to start.

If anyone is reading this that initially sent advice. Thank you. When you are in the thick of it, it is tough to not feel like it is impossible and you will never be able to overcome it. I needed the outside prospective.

tl;dr Update to a post about considering giving up custody of my kids, to fighting for them for years… eventually getting custody and turning all of our lives around for the better.

Commenter: Cheered when I heard both the kids got their grades up.

You’ve set them on the right path sir. Good work.

>**OOP:** Thanks! We knew they had the ability. It is amazing what can happen when kids have support with HW, and a routine to follow everyday. Soon they start believing in themselves and then setting their own lofty goals. Jill has dreams of becoming an investigative journalist.

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.  

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

Another Worst Secret Santa story,"EDIT: The year was 2007.

It just so happened that I drew my boss, and my boss drew me. There was a $20 limit, so I decided to get her favourite brand and scent of fragrance oil she used in her office diffuser. The oil cost $15, so I put it in a cute box full of tiny origami stars I’d made and strung into a garland for the back of her monitor (she loved decorating her office.)

I received a card, and inside was a note that said, “It’s been a pleasure working with you this year, now go clean out the store room.” I smiled and pretended there was a big joke inside, but my boss - laughing and smiling - took my card and read it aloud to everyone.

A few people laughed, then the HR lady (her best friend) asked if there was a gift. My boss said she’d “take care of me” later. The “taking care of me” was letting her drive me through the Starbucks drive thru and having a coffee on her company credit card while she spent the 10-minute drive not-apologizing and raving about her very funny joke. 

I smiled and chuckled and sipped my Pike Place and held back tears. $15 isn’t much, but every dollar counts and I had decided to short my own mother a stocking stuffer because of the secret Santa. I found a new job a few months later and spent the last few months there avoiding my boss. 

The kicker: HR asked if I received a present from my boss. I told the truth and said she bought me a coffee on the company card. She said she was sorry and would look into it. Crickets. Meanwhile, my boss’s monitor looked adorable, her office smelled fragrant, and I hope she told her story of how she fucked me over the holidays and got at least a small side-eye.",RadioSupply,2024-12-23,9867,coworkerstories

Facebook Marketplace seller wasted my morning and my gas,"I found a small van I wanted to convert. The price was good for the mileage. I reached out to the seller and told them I was interested and would like to see it, and that if it was good, they likely had a sale.

Seller responds with time and address for the following day. I agree to the time and thank them. Was excited that night and found it difficult to sleep.

The next day the seller messages me to inquire if I am still coming. I let them know that I am on my way (1.5 hours away with traffic).

When I am mere minutes away, they tell me they just sold it. Wasted 3 hours of my time and 1/4 tank of gas.

"Just happened - Told a group of co-worker who were shit talking me in another language 'Fuck off, I understood you'.","I work in IT and have friends from all over the globe.  A few years ago, I befriended a woman and her family, which (from what her husband told me) is rare for Indian culture.   Her husband and I have become two peas in a very dysFUNctional pod.  We brew together, he taught me about cricket, I taught him about forced induction on engines, just friend stuff.
 I've been working with him on his understanding and deep grasp of the English language, and he has helped me learn and understand Hindi, which I was overjoyed.  (I love cultures)

No one knows this except very few people I work with.  It's my super power.  Until today.

I'm sitting at work today and a group of contractors start a discussion in hindi, which at first I paid no attention to.  I managed to get a ton of work done this sprint, and they screwed around.  I made them look really bad.  

So they started talking shit about me to each other and one of the Indian managers sitting in their group.  It took me a hot second to catch what was going on, until I told them in Hindi - ""Fuck off, I understood what you said about me""

They all got this look like I had slapped them, they all got embarrassed and RAN like cockroaches to the 4 winds.  My boss just looked at me, asked what that was about, to which I said 'nothing, just a difference of opinions' and went back to work (he knows now).  As they took off, I felt like Sloth from the Goonies when he ripped his shirt and had the Superman emblem underneath.

My girl crossed the rainbow bridge and I just can’t bear how empty I am feeling ,"My 15 year old best friend, Cricket, crossed yesterday morning peacefully in my arms. I’ve had her since I was a teenager myself, and she was there with me during the times when nobody else was. She brought vibrancy to all the times that were grey and dull. 

Her littermate Luna is still with me and I love her dearly. I’m so worried for her. But also, Luna is quiet. She’s serene. Cricket greeted me with happy foot taps and butt wiggles and screams at the bottom of the stairs every morning, followed me everywhere, sat on my toes when I used the toilet. It’s just so quiet in my house. It’s so empty. Her memory feels like a vacuum where 6 pounds of spunk once sat.

She developed dementia over the past year and it got more intense with time. It went from 2 AM wake ups where we comforted her and she went back to sleep, to sleeping on the couch with her all night, to sleeping on the floor with her. Finally Sunday night she sundowned so badly that she would scream if my partner or myself even touched her. She was confused and terrified and didn’t deserve to suffer anymore. She died at home with us right by her side. She fell asleep in my arms eating Reese’s cups for the first time.

I ate several courses at an insect cuisine restaurant in Tokyo. The food was weird! ,"Full video of my experience is at https://youtu.be/qbZ8ogfdrEk?si=civbqsKg0x2u-qSy

This was a super neat evening at a restaurant called Rice & Circus full of crazy foods I've never tried, or perhaps even knew where things people ate. Pictured here is a Japanese sea bug, a Scorpion, and a platter of insects. I also had badger (my favorite thing), snake penis, cockroach sake and whale sashimi...which I'd wanted to try whale at least once in my life even though I feel indifferent about people eating them. In short, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I simply said yes to everything offered to me - and almost everything was pretty tasty!

The restaurant owners were very nice and were mother and son. They believed strongly that people must start finding new food sources as the population increases, and   thus their motivation. This restaurant was very small and off the beaten path, but I'd made sure they'd never had any issues of food poisoning etc.

I need you guys to start being normal,"You know if this applies to you or not. I need you people to have common courtesy towards others rather than completely ignoring anything other than yourselves.

I was walking to the one line after going out with my friends and we see a group of people walking a dog, I go ""hey you have a cute dog!"" They literally just stare back at me and my friend, acting as if we're a weirdo.

I go in the elevator first ""oh what floor do you want"" then get ignored and they press it anyways.

I go hold the door open for someone, the percentage chance I get any acknowledgement is about 20%.

I go past someone in a grocery aisle thats a little too tight ""oh pardon me"" \*crickets\*

It cannot possibly make you have a better day intentionally ignoring any and all interactions with another human being regardless of how mild. And I know someones gonna say ""I don't owe you a conversation"" A conversation is not my request, I'm asking for a polite response. ""Oh thanks yeah shes gorgeous! Have a good night!"" ""I'm on the 6th floor, thanks bro"" ""oh excuse me"" its really not hard to be polite and not invite further conversation. I genuinely do not understand how this makes your day better and not worse become calloused to any and all interactions outside yourself.

Walking through this city its as if youre the only person who exists. People act like people here are unkind but polite but I don't agree. Refusing to acknowledge someone attempting to do a small service or act of kindness is neither polite or kind.",Long-Train-1673,2024-08-29,8415,Seattle

my rosie is 7 years old and still very small and hasn’t eaten in over 2 years but she seems to be completely fine,"hi so i have a rose hair tarantula that i’ve had since i was 15 and im 22 now so she’s 7, i say she because im assuming if she was a male she would be dead at this point coz i know females live twice as long as the males unless males only die when they reach sexual maturity but she’s still basically sling sized, the last time she shed her skin was january 2018 and the last time she ate was june 2022 but she appears to be fine she has water at all times and i make sure her tank isn’t too dry, her abdomen isn’t shrunken she’s still nice and plump and she isn’t doing the “death curl” she isn’t slow and sluggish and still can move around fairly fast, she appears to be healthy but whenever i do try feed her which is rare i know that sounds bad but i know she will refuse which im right, she looks like she’s gonna pounce then runs away from her waxworms which is what i feed her as i used to feed her crickets when i first got her but my mother had a full blown panic attack when i brought them into the house she’s absolutely petrified of things like that, not my spider she’s fine w them but yeah only waxies i feed her which i know are usually a treat but she’s eaten them before but hasn’t eaten in over 2 years now, she has a big enough tank, plenty of room to move about, she is a pet rock tho as rosie’s are nicknamed lol she does absolutely fuck all and just sits on her ass most of the time and only occasionally i’ll see her move about she’s very chill and lazy lol🫠 i’ll post a picture of her so you can see:) i know rosie’s are very slow growers but surely not this slow?!🫠 she’s 7 but shes still extremely small probably because she refuses food too, i’ll even kill it for her and leave it in her tank for a day to see if she eats it but nope she doesn’t bother w it🥲 ",moveslikethewind666,2024-07-28,6911,tarantulas

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

Is my girl ok?,"I have a rose hair tarantula that I inherited from a friend. She is just over 35 years old, and was my friend’s pet since his childhood. For the past 3 days she has been in this position not moving. She had been eating and drinking normally before (2-3 crickets every two weeks). Yesterday she waved her legs about a bit but returned to this position. I’m worried that she might be dying due to her age, and want to do what I can to keep her comfortable. Having said that I don’t know what this behavior indicates, and I’m hoping it’s something normal. My son thinks she might be trying to get out of her enclosure and wants to bring her outside to experience nature before she goes (under supervision, we would not let her get eaten or anything and would bring her back in after a field trip. I am worried doing that might cause her a lot of stress though. Does anybody have some advice for us?

I (31F) have 3 siblings (40M, 38F, 27M) and we have a good relationship despite the age gaps between some of us. My older siblings are both married and so am I, the wedding in question is my younger brother's.

My younger brother 'Luke' is engaged to his gf of a year 'Emma' (28F), she is nice I guess but we have never really clicked and are just polite to each other. Something important is that we are all Catholic, but not really hardcore ones and some of us are even lapsed.

I do believe this whole situation started just when I met her for the first time. I look younger than Luke and it has always been a sibling joke that I am truly the baby of the family, most people that meet us assume he is older than me but nobody has had issues with it until Emma. The day I met her she kind of scoffed when I said I was happy the baby had a proper girlfriend, she has this weird thing about being the Eldest in her family and refused to believe I was older than her until I showed her my ID. She has been hot and cold with me since then, often infantilizing me or trying to have a sort of boss attitude. I just let her be and usually ignore her since I have no time to try and beg for her friendship so I am just polite and civil, always include her when planning stuff but don't really make an effort.

The family knows about it but we just shrugged it to different personalities. Then the wedding planning started. Emma decided I could not be in the wedding party since I was not married in a church, fine by me. Then she requested that immediate family submits their dress plannings so she could check it fits the wedding dress code, fine whatever. You see where this is going I hope? You'll see I have not gone to confession or have communion in more than a decade, If I go to a mass for whatever reason I am respectful and simply sit or stay standing during the rites I don't participate on. Well this is not good enough for her and she says I need to take communion during their wedding, I said no and she has not taken it well.

For the most part I avoid her as I said before but this time I wasn't gonna say yes or risk an issue. I told her for taking communion one needs to go to confession and I didn't want to. She said all immediate family is doing it and it will look bad if I don't, I told her sure fine, then I'll just go have communion in front of everybody but won't do confession. She said if this was gonna be my attitude I was uninvited from the wedding because I clearly wanted to ruin the day for her. I turned to my brother and told him 'thanks' gave him a thumbs up and went home.

My family understand my reasoning and said they respect everybody's choices but I shouldn't have said what I said. I told them I really don't want to go to the wedding anymore and I don't owe Emma explanations on my life. I only called my Grandma because she heard what happened and asked me not to disrespect the church by doing the communion without confession, I promised I wouldn't do it and she is fine with me now.

I got a text from my brother wanting to compromise so I replied by asking if the other lapsed people are being made to take confession too? He said no because it was only nuclear family members, I find it funny since all the others are clearly older than her and she just behaves like this with me and the youngsters. AITAH?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: You should alert the Priest to her behavior. He will ensure that she stops with her actions. She cannot make rules that do not exist in the church. I would send a quick email to him and let her deal with the consequences of her own actions.

>**OOP:** I actually considered it but I don't think I will since my Grandma might be doing it herself. She is lapsed herself but didn't want me to be disrespectful, but she knows the priest that will be officiating and is not really happy with all the shitshow.

*Demand an apology in order to go:*

>I already told my parents I am not coming no matter what. They are clearly not pleased with how she spoke to me, but even more displeased with my brother but we agreed on not intervening more. If he wants to marry her it's his decision, he's an adult and needs no permission but what he would lose has been made clear to him.

Commenter: I would let Grandma handle it... She sounds feisty, how old is she?

>**OOP:** My Grandpa used to say she was like a firecracker lol. She's 81 and has been lapsed for like 25 years I think. She still has friends in the church community and all but they respect her decision not to participate in the rites anymore.

Commenter: Can't you just go get a blessing? I'm an atheist but my parents are hardcore Catholics and my dad became a Deacon last year. They asked us (me and my siblings) to go get blessings as a compromise as none of us are religious. I still declined personally but my understanding is that going to get a blessing is common for non-confirmed and considered an act of participation. If you're just lapsed, rather than actively rejectful, then that seems like a perfect compromise and one where you can pretend to be going for communion before crossing your arms before the priest (or whichever signal said church uses).

>**OOP:** My issue is not about the blessing, it's that she singles me out and wants to have some sort of authority above me. A bunch of my family are lapsed but she has not made a big deal over it except of me.  
her stupid argument falls apart because my oldest brother is also lapsed but she doesn't seem to care or maybe she has not realized it. She has not mentioned anything to him, but is making a huge deal because I don't participate.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gcwzhl/update_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to_confession/) **1: October 26, 2024 (Next Day)**

Things have moved but I wouldn't call any of this a positive progress. 

I would like to clear something I kept seeing in the comments. I won't request a special blessing or go in the queue for communion, it isn't about the blessing or the compromise but the singling me out. I often just stay quiet or take a general family blessing if we go to weddings, etc. I have no issue with compromises I have an issue with Emma and her ridiculousness. I don't know why she has this thing with me, I do look young but not like a teen or a child obviously. She has 2 younger sisters and is very authoritative with them, I have witnesses her being very my way or the highway with younger people so she has issues for sure. 

The confrontation from the last post was on Tuesday and today we had lunch at my Grandma's. I think you should also know that my brothers have a tricky relationship, as in they are not as close with each other as they are with other siblings. My older brother 'Robert' is very no nonsense and he has never been a fan of Emma but he didn't think he should have to intervene because Luke is an adult and capable of navigating relationships. All this is gonna be relevant I promise. 

We visit Grandma a lot since she lives by herself and we truly enjoy her company. Today we were all there because she is over this drama already. After a lunch, that was more like snacking to be honest, she asked us all to clear the air. Emma continued with her rant about me being a disrespectful person and that she was asking the bare minimum from me. My Grandma asked her why she had no issue with her not taking communion and Emma said that she was her elder and for sure her reasons were more than a tantrum like it was in my case. She also repeated that she was asking this of all the siblings and I was the only one that was being difficult with her tiny request. 

This is where everything crumbled for her. I mentioned in the comments that Robert is also lapsed and he was already exhausted by this situation. He asked her why she had no issues with him not taking communion and she looked like a kid that was caught. She didn't have a proper answer. Robert then asked her if she even knew why he and Grandma became lapsed. She shook her head and looked at Luke for help, Luke on the other hand was staring angrily at Robert and I but said nothing. 

Robert explained to Emma he was the reason Grandma became lapsed. When Robert was a teen he came out as gay and was so worried about our Grandparents reaction since they were very active in the Catholic church. Grandma felt awful about it and even worse when she went and spoke about this with the then Priest of her Church, that Priest was super old school and told her that Robert was committing sins, he was going to hell, he needed to find his way, the whole nine yards. Grandma didn't take that so well and simply stopped going to Church and started spending that time with her grandchildren. Over the years she started getting into the whole community again but she decided she was done taking the sacraments, she respects parts of the church but can't fully reconcile with it.

Emma was a bit confused since Robert is married to a woman and he explained he is bisexual and ended up with a woman just as he could have ended with a man. He also commented they are not married in the church but that didn't matter to her like it mattered when it came to me. He asked her directly what was her problem with me.

Long story short, she said I was rude since the beginning and kept treating Luke wrong. Oh and I also was very snarky about looking younger than her. Crickets. She is a beautiful successful woman so I still don't understand her obsession but it seems like she wants people to see I respect her and what she says. I just started laughing, she started crying and saying I turned my Grandma against her. My Grandma told her to stop blaming people for her being a negative person and she was always going to side with me over her. Luke got upset at that and asked her why she was not supporting him and she simply said she doesn't support him being a lap dog for a crazy woman. 

More was said, nothing got truly resolved. I was kind of invited again but declined going, Grandma is undecided if she even wants to go at all. My older siblings told Luke they will go to the ceremony if he seeks couples therapy or at least therapy. My parents are having headaches and now dislike Emma so much they can't hide it. Oh! And yes Grandma spoke with the Priest and he wants them to do extra premarital counseling or he won't officiate.

I hope they don't get married but he is old enough to derail his life if he wants. I thank you for letting me vent and my Grandma loved the Pope joke!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gebhae/update_2_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to/) **2: October 28, 2024 (2 days later, 3 from OG post)**

My brother has gone too far and I decided to be done with him. He made our Grandma cry and I think permanently damaged a lot of his relationships. I want to mention some of my cousins and other family members thought I was just stubborn and creating drama but now there is no longer my side or Emma's side. Maybe he always felt this way but the issue he has with Robert is absolutely ridiculous.

He was so upset with what Grandma said about him being Emma's lap dog that he called her to speak about it. I was obviously not present for the conversation but Grandma told me what happened and Luke confirmed it.

He told her that it was unfair of me to ask Robert for help since he was her favorite grandchild and would get her to side with me no matter how wrong I was. He also told her that many of the cousins believe this and that it was so obvious since she even left her religion for him, he claimed the other LGBTQ+ members of the family (most were not even born when Robert came out by the way) doubted if she would do it for them.

So Grandma explained to Luke and then call every single one of her grandchildren to ask them how they felt and explain to each a part we didn't know. She said that when Robert came out and she spoke with the old Priest he hinted about knowing of places to set Robert 'straight'. Grandma had heard horror stories from this places and so had Robert and they both spoke with my parents together about that not being an option at all. My parents never intended to send Robert there and are very casual Catholics, but Grandma wanted to cover the basis just in case. I was told Grandma sounded like she had being crying on the phone and after the first couple of calls, which went from oldest to youngest the group chat started to blow. Robert is livid, our LGBTQ+ cousins are livid and say Luke lied, even the cousins that were telling me to stop being a stubborn head are livid.

By the time I was up for my call I was already on the way to Grandma's. Two of my cousins were already there and the youngest one, Sara (16F), was ready to literally fight Luke. For a bit of levity Sara is about 35 cm smaller than Luke and the image of her swinging at him made me laugh a bit, she asked if I was making fun of her and I just explained the whole mental image of her trying to hit him and she admitted it was kind of funny. What I didn't tell her is I would love to slap some sense into Luke.

My Grandma has been through so much in her life and this is not what we want for her. She looks puffy faced and kept asking everybody if they truly felt unloved by her, saying she would do everything for any of us. Explaining how Robert was the oldest grandchild but that didn't mean she loved the rest any less. She is a strong woman, but I think something inside her broke a little with the thought she hurt her grandchildren. It was a shitshow, a big one and I was just so done with Luke.

My parents have been passive towards the situation so far because I asked them to, but after they heard what happened they told him they need time away from him. Robert is simply disgusted and decided to not speak with him anymore, which he communicated through the cousin group chat with Luke's response being that this is why Emma's help on reining all us would be so beneficial if we just let her. He also added how Robert never cared for him or anybody really and he just tried to be the center of attention all the time. He cited his coming out, his announcement he was gonna marry a woman, the birth of his child, it was ridiculous. He came out when Luke was a toddler and for many years only our parents and grandparents knew. He announced he was gonna marry his now wife through a text but didn't interfere or took from anybody. His child was born 4 months before Luke's graduation and apparently that was a big issue for Luke that he never commented.

Maybe I am biased, maybe I am selfish like Emma claims, but I call bullshit on his tantrum. Every single one of the cousins has been helped, babysat, tutored, gotten out of trouble, you name it by Robert. He isn't perfect but he isn't the conniving ass Luke is claiming. Maybe Luke has always felt inadequate and we didn't notice, maybe it was his last ditch effort, maybe Emma has manipulated him so far that he can't come back. It doesn't matter anymore.

If he does marry Emma I wish him the best, if he doesn't I hope he goes to therapy. Regardless of what he decides he burned so many bridges and hurt so many people, I don't see this resolving any time soon. For now I will focus on my Grandma and making her feel better. I feel extremely guilty because it was Emma's situation with me that opened this can of worms, I know I shouldn't but it's hard not to.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wow it sounds like it is self projection from Luke he is the conniving asshole he is saying Robert is.

>**OOP:** Robert is the type of older cousin Sara would call if she is drunk at a party and needs a safe ride. He also did it for Luke which is why I don't get his deal.

*OOP's relationship with Luke:*

>**OOP:** If he asked for help and apologized sincerely, I would be there in 2 seconds. He knew what he was doing when he spoke with out Grandma, he knew it would cause her pain, he knew he would hurt Robert too.  
Robert might not be crying but he feels bad about the situation, he has always looked out for everybody and even has pics of him holding every single one of us as babies all over one of his walls. I always knew there were not the closest of brothers but this is too much.

Commenter: It may be that her purpose is to isolate him. Please tell your grandmother from another old lady not to doubt herself because Luke has decided to live in crazy town

>**OOP:** I don't know anymore. He is still very active with our maternal family so far, I am unsure how they will react when or if they hear what happened because both families have a great relationship. He still has a strong support system when it comes to friends, some even dislike or disapprove of Emma and are vocal about it.  
I am seriously on the wave that this was low key less about me and more a poke to Robert.  
And thanks, she really needs a lot of love.

Commenter: \[...\] Look back at her having an issue with you because of how you mistreat Luke. Which from your account doesn't seem happens. It sounds like your brother has created a narrative of the situation that is likely not recognizable as truth by anyone else. Maybe he resents being the kid and no one listening to him and figures he can get his way by acting victim. Who knows? 

>**OOP:** You hit a point I have been trying to avoid. Maybe he has been like this all the time and Emma is just putting a magnifier on it.  
I must say he was the center of attention when it was about him: graduations, birthdays, presentations, engagement party. He got celebrated on his achievements just as loud as everybody else. Grandma tried to always be there, so did our parents.  
He was always invited to stuff, always asked for his opinion on group decisions, he has always been loved.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gjqbob/update_3_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to/3:) **3: November 4, 2024 (1 week later)**

I want to start this by saying that Grandma is in better spirits now. I am overwhelmed by the amount of people supporting her and very grateful for it even if it's online. I have talked about this on some chats and dms but please know the situation with Emma is not about her being parentified or her family being strict Catholics, it's just her being her. They were already going to get premarital counseling, an extra was added. Oh, all cousins also don't live in the same city or town, some are a bit longer than others but we keep in touch through the chat.

The reason for the update is mainly to let people know Grandma is ok, her health is fine, and she had a blast with my cousin Sara. I also want to update on what has happened with the cousins and the maternal side of our family. Some of our paternal cousins, from Grandma's side, have relented and feel a bit bad on excluding Luke from things so the compromise was met on 'he can be invited to everything, just don't force people to interact'. These cousins are mainly on the older side and have soft spots for the youngsters. My youngest cousin, Sara, said she was ok with it all but she wanted them to keep him away from her since she can't stand him anymore.

Our maternal side was a shitshow, because of course we need one. Some of them were very upset but others told me I should try to understand where he was coming from. My Mom was the one that told them everything and some told her she is at fault for making Robert the 'star' of the family. This was so uncalled for but brought some issues in my family, particularly when one of my maternal cousins asked me if I could behave enough if I am seated at the same table as Luke for his wedding. It makes us doubt ourselves but really, this is a cousin that Robert has bailed from almost brankruptcy 2 times and he's the problem?

I haven't said much about my sister 'Lucy' since she voiced nothing different before, she was always very close to Luke and even had a great relationship with Emma before the debacle. She decided to be out of it because she was so disappointed. While she was never made to babysit or anything like that she was always so into Luke since he was her baby brother, she loved him the most and I know that because she literally told me when I was a kid. We have a good relationship now because her kids are my buddies but it was rough for a while before that. She was upset about the whole thing but when our maternal family, or at least a part, started excusing Luke she lost it. She is a very calm person, the type you don't expect a bad word out of, but she lost it and I think it was the last straw on the cold bucket for Luke.

She sent a massive message about what has been happening, detailing every single thing, and daring people to kind of 'come at her' if they disagreed. She made sure to include every single nasty thing, every bad word, every eye roll. She sent it to so many people because she was tired of the half information telephone game. She is upset at me because my refusals made this happen and she said she knows she shouldn't but she needs time to fix her feelings so she is not speaking with me right now.

My parents decided they were out of the wedding and told Luke he is on his own. There was never a monetary issue, they were willing to contribute but both Luke and Emma are pretty well off and was no need for that.

Now to what maybe most people want to know and the only conflict I am interested about anymore. My Grandma is feeling better, Sara being with her was very positive. It was lovely to see the eldest and youngest of our family so in tune but then again they have always been. She requested that Sara invited Luke to her birthday party (December) and after a lot of back and forward he is going to be invited. We will see if he comes or not.

A small parenthesis, I showed my grandma the joke of the knife, sword, etc, she was so giddy. Thank you *\[editor's note- this is the scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring- ""you have my sword"" ""and you have my bow"" ""and MY AXE.""*

I mentioned before that Robert would pick up Sara if she needed, it is still true, what I might have not mentioned is that she of course gets a weird lecture from him and an even weirder lecture on how he rates certain drugs. lol As I said, he is no saint, but he is not a shit either. Lastly, yes he has photos even with my sister or me in the new born wall. People loved to take pics of him holding the new family members and he collected them and put them together when he got his own house.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: How did we go from ""I won't do confession"" to everyone blaming Robert for the end of your brotherly relationship while simultaneously all of them also blaming you for everything?

>**OOP:** Have you met Catholic families?  
jokes aside, I think it's easier to blame Robert and I than Luke since we are not gonna go on a rampage that would hurt people.

*Sister:*

>I think my sister is upset with me because of her closeness with Luke. She used to tell me she loved me but not like Luke. She always babied him and was upset her kids were closer to me than Luke but never forced anything.

*The LOTR quotes:*

>She was so excited that Sara almost convinced her to watch LOTR, almost

*""bailed out"" cousin:*

>It's deeper than that, the first time it happened Robert organized a fund so people could help out and do it faster. The second time, he even sold a couple stuff so he would reach the goal faster. This cousin has a house because of Robert, and Robert does this type of things because he doesn't want anybody to feel powerless.  
Robert made clear he will not help him anymore and made it clear, my cousin is spiraling now.

**\*\*\*\*\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h7guh3/update_4_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to/) **4: December 5, 2024 (1 month later, 1.5 months from OG post)\*\*\*\*\***

As I mentioned in my last update, some of the older cousins were feeling bad about excluding Luke and the compromised was reached. But as good or as much as we want to be good, we are no saints so we decided to test the waters before the birthday to be safe. We had a lunch party with a lot of the family in attendance and tried our best, or at least some of us did. 

During the trial lunch Emma was trying to get Sara to speak with her. As I mentioned before, Sara was looking into following on Luke and Sara's steps but now she doesn't even want to be in the same room as them. Emma has not taken this well and tried to engage Sara several times before the lunch but Sara was not budging so at one point Emma lost it. She grabbed her by the arm and sternly told her she needs to stop being disrespectful and well Sara lost it. She started screaming at Emma to don't touch her (in way more colorful language) and everybody lost their shit. Fortunately Luke was close by and took Emma and Sara apart. How this adult thought it was a good idea to grab a teenager is beyond me, but then again this is Emma we're talking about. Things calmed down a bit and the rest of the day was uneventful apart from Emma's stares.

Emma was blocked by most people and she was very hurt by it. How do I know this? Because Luke made a whole speech about it to my parents but well. She is now particularly focused on Sara being rude to her and calling her a disrespectful child. She of course blames me for starting this and is sure I put ideas in everybody's heads. 

In total I have met Luke and Emma about 3 times since my last update and kept my distance. Luke has been ignoring Robert making a big show about doing it every time, like a child. My sister came around and started talking with me again and not much has changed since we were never that close and it's mainly to coordinate meetings between my niblings and I. 

Now on to the important event that was Grandma's birthday: It was amazing! She had a blast with family and friends that wanted to celebrate her, she is very well liked so it was a considerable amount of people in attendance. She was like a giddy princess and didn't stop smiling the whole time. The only wrinkle was Emma and Luke giving out their wedding invitations, it was tacky but nobody was surprised. Some of my maternal family members in attendance were a bit awkward about it while some of my paternal family simply left the invitations on their tables. Emma gave them to my husband and Robert's wife which made them laugh and she was annoyed but didn't say anything. 

They also got Grandma the envelop in front of some of her friends and asked her to please open it. Luke knows we never open anything until after the parties but the insistence was such she did, read what it was, said thank you, and went back to her conversation. I assume they were expecting her to be excited or share the news with her friends but that was obviously not going to happen. Luke approached Sara with hers and told her Emma has decided to make her a bridesmaid to repair their relationship, Sara replied with *woof woof*, Luke looked like he was about to cry. He used to be Sara's idol and she adored him, now she mocks him. He told our aunt and uncle she should be grounded for being so mean and they said they agreed with it. Sara received a 15 minutes punishment of helping carry gifts to the car.    

The wedding date is March 27th, they will have the reception in a family backyard (still a pretty big space, enough for like 100) due to the considerable downsizing they had to do since a lot of people are rsvping no or simply not even acknowledging the invitation at all. They tried to pull a hail mary during the birthday but it was a fiasco. Grandma has officially declined the invite and we will plan something fun for that weekend.

I guess this is it, the countdown to see if he actually marries her is on! And yes I know it sounds mean but we truly hope he doesn't but we'll see.  

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: This is far from over. You guys need to wall off Sara. A teen shouldn't have to defend herself from crazy ass Emma. And by no means should she be a bridesmaid. I can imagine the kind of crazy ass entitled shit she'd have to do for the wedding. Don't Emma have friends she can torture instead?

>**OOP:** It was a quick moment and totally unexpected, Emma had never try anything physical before. Sara isn't even going to the wedding let alone being a bridesmaid! It's just Emma being her ridiculous self thinking she can control others.  
Emma already has 4 bridesmaids, including friends, although I am not up to date with the actual number.

*Emma's family:*

>Well I can let you know what I know. She loves to be ""in charge"" and her parent have always enabled her. She has younger sisters and thrives on being a respected person, it's a bit like an obsession of her. The few times I met her family they seemed a bit snobbish but polite people, they do know about all that has been happening and contacted my parents after the birthday party because Emma was very hurt people dismissed the invitations and felt our attitude towards Emma and Luke, particularly that of Grandma and Sara were out of line. I truly don't know what they expect??? For my Dad to ground her mother for not participating in the circus that is the wedding or force Sara to be a bridesmaid to a woman she doesn't intent to talk to ever again?  
It seems like Emma's entitlement comes from her being treated like a princess that does no wrong, but that doesn't fly with my family.

Commenter: I have a feeling the Luke is eyeballs deep into the sunk cost fallacy. \[...\]

>**OOP:** There is a theory going around my family that they haven't had sex and that's why he is like this.

AITA for refusing to let my partner's best friend sleep in one of our spare bedrooms while she's getting divorced?,"**I am NOT OOP, OOP is** u/Lost_Coconut_1841
 
**Originally posted to r/AITAH**

**AITA for refusing to let my partner's best friend sleep in one of our spare bedrooms while she's getting divorced?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!emotional affair, infidelity, manipulation!<

---------------------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/i890CDRxOB): **June 4, 2024**

My girlfriend Anna (32F, all names changed btw) and I (35M) are currently living in a house that I owned since before the start of our relationship.

Anna's best friend, Kathrine (33F), and I never really got along. Partially maybe because we're very different types of people but primarily it's because she doesn't approve of the fact that Anna and I have an open relationship. Ever since Anna disclosed this fact to Katherine, she accused me of cheating and that I pressured Anna into it. Our interactions have gone from frosty to cold.

And just to set the record straight: it's not cheating. Cheating absolutely exists in open relationships, the thresholds are just set through discussion and neither of us ever did anything that's against these agreed upon hard rules ever.

Also neither one of us pressured the other one: We just had a conversation early in our relationship why our previous relationships failed and realized that both of us struggled with relationships getting ""routine"" and we weren't ready to mothball the thrill and excitement of meeting and dating new people yet. As we're both not particularly jealous people we decided to try a non-monogamous relationship and it worked well for us ever since.

I also already tried explaining this to Katherine once or twice, so from my point of view I did my due diligence to have a good relationship with her but her perception of that might differ.

Anyways: Last week Anna had an unexpected emergency call from Katherine and, as it turns out, she's serving her hubby with divorce papers because he had a secret affair over the last few months. As a good friend does, Anna immediately invited her friend to stay at our place for a few weeks until things are sorted out. Katherine doesn't have family here but we both have beds in our respective home offices and so in her mind it was the perfect solution.

When Anna told me a few minutes after the call, I quickly had to pump the brakes. I'm not going to lie that the idea of having a hostile houseguest in my own home isn't unappealing on its own already but that's not even my main reason: Both Anna and I have friends with benefits/secondary partners that occasionally stay over when Anna works night shift or I'm traveling for work and they also visit just for the occasional, platonic movie night or dinner party. Friends with benefits are friends after all.

Now, having Katherine here would mean we'd either have to significantly scale back these relationships for an undetermined length of time or have them over anyways. As I imagine Katherine is probably even less tolerant towards perceived infidelity right now, that would probably just be a shitty to hostile experience for our other partners.

Both of these things, to me, sound unfair towards me and our secondary relationships. As we always saw these as real relationships that deserve respect and consideration just as much as our relationship (within some increments of prioritisation of course), I told Anna that I don't want Katherine living here.

Anna pretty much saw my reasoning right away and, given that I own the house, apologized for her rushed invitation and called Katherine to take it back. But since then the situation has gotten out of hand tbh.

Our friends are pretty much split along the lines of ""it's your house"" and ""wow, you put Katherine on the streets just because of your side chicks?"" And Katherine kicked the conversation up an additional notch by insinuating that I'm trying to isolate Anna from her and just said no because I hate that they are friends. For the record: I never had a problem with their friendship nor did I ever do anything to limit it.

Anyways, I'm increasingly starting to wonder if my objection has been worth it and the right call or if it's been unfair towards Katherine.

So AITA?

Edit: Maybe to clarify... Katherine has never been outwardly aggressive or offensive against me. It's always been insinuations and probably gossip.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP responds to multiple questions on why other people are involved in OOP’s relationship with his wife**

**OOP:** 

> Why are other people involved?

Because Katherine looped in additional friends against my/our will.

> Katherine is an adult, she is able to resolve her own problems

Yeah, I'd love to do that but I'd feel much more comfortable if this situation is resolved or at least pacified, too. We disclosed our relationship status on basically a ""need to know"" basis and my worry is that Katherine might actually make it known to people that don't know yet if she continues and this keeps spiraling.

But that's a separate dilemma.

**leaving4me:** NTA It should have been discussed with you prior to offering, but Anna seems pretty rational and course corrected. There are plenty of ways for Anna to support Katherine other than to to bring this person into your home that judges you and does not accept your relationship. Your objection is worth it as it sound like if Katherine moves in for a term she will serve to cause you problems and frustration.

> **OOP:** Given how much she's already managing to do that from the outside, inviting her in is basically out of the question at this point.
> 
> My ideas for extending the olive branch would have been apologizing, maybe trying to find an apartment or a very short stay.

**Cute-Profession9983:** NTA and Katherine's reaction is all the proof you needed to keep her out of your house. Also, you're not making her homeless, SHE IS. She could have told the cheater to leave.

> **OOP:** Actually one of my compromises I suggested when telling Anna ""no"" was to take in Katherine's hubby for a month on a purely functional ""a bed to sleep"" basis but basically Katherine doesn't want to be at their shared home right now because the affair also took place there.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/WY0ri4TPFD): **June 16, 2024**

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/AeVoOIesE9)

I figured I'd be giving an update because I still get ""X upvotes!"" notifications for my initial post somehow. The responses were also actually kinda helpful so I'd also like to say thanks and share the outcome.

It was reassuring that so many people agreed we weren't out of line and we should stick with our decision. Even more helpful were the questions why we didn't turn the tables, got in front of the supposed backlash (more on that later) and said ""well, why don't you host her then?""

What can I say except that we're not located somewhere where everyone from your barber to your second cousin will blow up your inbox/socials and call you an asshole to your face on behalf on a third party.

We only heard about the criticism against us through the grapevine and we didn't really have a specific person to say ""well, then you take her"" to. But, after reading your comments, Anna got the idea to let out a WhatsApp broadcast to our shared friend group. It basically said that we're feeling ~~vErY gUilTy BeCAuSe oF KaThEriNE's sITuAtiOn~~, sorry, very guilty because of Katherine's situation and that it was shitty to make a promise and then take it back... but we simply realized that our lifestyle seem like it might be triggering to her in her current situation that would be uncomfortable for everyone involved... ""But we'd be happy to help anyone who'll take her in in whatever way we can.""

Cue the crickets.

That was the moment we realized that maybe there were less people on Katherine's side than we initially assumed. Actually, only one couple - who were friends with both Katherine and her hubby - reached out to invite us to dinner, apparently to share some things we weren't aware of yet.

First of all, according to them the ""affair"" wasn't the carnal thing Katherine made it out to be and more of a ""falling out of love"" situation on the husband's side that has long been coming. Basically he met someone and that made him realize that his marriage was dead. And he did the moral thing and broke up with Katherine. No one is 100% sure if there's been something physical before that but I wouldn't be surprised if that was all in Katherine's head.

There's also apparently a very juicy reason why he gets to keep staying in the house but this update is long enough already.

Anyways, as for the whole smear campaign lodged against us... turns out that the whole drama apparently consisted of only three things:

* Katherine trying to pressure us and (consciously or unconsciously) sowing rumors that everybody is really angry with us
* A single couple that stood on Katherine's side
* And a lot of people hoping to not get pulled into a war of roses and just nodding politely

The couple that was on Katherine's side are the friends that Katherine hit up right after us by the way. The dinner party friend's theory is that they threw us under the bus and fed into Katherine's outrage because that couple has a young daughter and we know for a fact that Katherine has just as many Karen-style convictions about parenting as she has about relationship styles.

Anyways, Katherine is now basically ostracized, moved in with family a bit outside the city and is working remotely until she finds a condo to haunt this city from again.

I also want to clarify a few things from the original post.

To the people that insinuated that I pressured Anna into this relationship or keep her on a short leash: Given how NM dating works out for different genders, trust me when I tell you she isn't lacking options to get out of this relationship if she wanted.

To the ones that criticized her for not standing up for me: I consciously didn't want to include this part because I didn't want to invite judgment of Anna (yeah, hindsight is 20/20) but that has been a dicey subject in our relationship.

But after having Anna's explicit permission to share this here now... There's actually a lot of backstory with Katherine adopting a loner Anna into her friend group back in their school days and Anna somehow still feeling like she needed to ""earn her place"" in the friend group/be grateful for Katherine. She's currently looking into going to therapy for that.

Finally, I want to add a last bit of positive news coming out of this shit show. This whole fiasco made Anna and me talk through the whole ""someone else moving in"" topic. It's not really something we're gonna do in the near future but Anna told me that there's one person she's currently seeing with whom she might be eventually moving into that direction. And this time she asked me early if I'd be okay with her moving in with us somewhere in the future (hinge not throuple for the people that speak poly on here).

I kinda like that Katherine would probably hate that this is the outcome of her whole tantrum. But other than that, I'm really happy things are mainly back to normal now.

I HATE potential adopters who ghost you,"So I had a woman looking for 2 kittens her kids for Christmas. Since I'm in the NE US, kittens are at a premium. And I have 6 adorable ones that are/will be ready by Tuesday. 

We texted a lot on Thursday. Saturday I took Christmas photos of the kits and sent her. She loved them. 

Tonight I texted to get things tied down. I even offered to keep the kittens until Christmas provided they adopted this weekend. Crickets. Several hours later and no response, although it shows my text has been read. 

Seriously? Just say ""Sorry, we changed out minds."" That's it. Don't leave me hanging wondering. I know my kittens will be adopted this weekend, because it's Christmas. And they are adorable. But I hate people who do this.

I'm fine if people change their mind. I've told people I meet up with if they have doubts, not to adopt. That's not my issue. Just let me know. I spent time on this. I'm trying to make plans and waiting on you to respond when it appears you aren't, is frustrating. 

And this is why I NEVER hold kittens. Because AH like this don't bother to tell you things change. 

It's okay. Rikki here deserves better.

"The Murder of Sergeant Leonard Siffleet, October 24th 1943","Sergeant Leonard George Siffleet was born to a family of Dutch ancestry on January 14th 1916 in Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia. In the 1930s he moved to Sydney, where he was rejected from the police forces due to his eyesight. He was called up for militia service in August 1940 and manned a searchlight at RAAF Richmond.

He was released from service after three months, returning home to help raise his younger brothers after the death of his mother. In September 1941, he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force and was assigned to a signals company at Ingleburn. By this time he had become engaged to Clarice Lane.

With Japan attacking Australia directly and occupying New Guinea, he volunteered for special operations in September 1942. By May 1943 he had been promoted to Sergeant and assigned to the elite M Special Unit of the Services Reconnaissance Department. 

The M Special Unit was ordered to establish a coastwatching station behind Hollandia in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, now Jayapura in West Papua. The Coastwatchers were Allied intelligence operatives who reported on Japanese military movements and rescued downed Allied airmen. Coastwatcher director Commander Eric Feldt described Siffleet as ‘the best type of NCO of the AIF, young and competent.’

Sergeant Siffleet’s party was led by Sergeant Thjis Staverman on the Royal Netherlands Navy. The other two men were Ambonese troops - Private H. Pattiwal and Private M. Reharing. They began their mission, Operation Whiting, in July, trekking across the mountains of north-east New Guinea through August and September. Sergeant Staverman and Private Pattiwal separated to further scout the area, but were captured by a local pro-Japanese militia. Sergeant Staverman was killed, but Private Pattiwal escaped and rejoined Sergeant Siffleet and Private Reharing. The group attempted to reach the border of the Dutch East Indies, but were ambushed by more pro-Japanese militia. Despite Sergeant Siffleet wounding one of the attackers, they were captured and handed to the Japanese military.

For two weeks, the three were interrogated and tortured by Japanese troops. Then, on October 24th, they were bound, blindfolded, and taken to the beach of Aitape by Yasuno Chikao on the orders of Imperial Japanese Navy Vice-Admiral Michiaki Kamada. Here, the three were illegally executed by beheading. Chikao ordered that he be photographed executing Sergeant Siffleet, who was 27 years old.

Kamada was hanged in 1947 after being found guilty of the murder of 1,500 Borneans and the mistreatment of 2,000 Dutch POWs.

In April 1944, the photo was discovered on the corpse of a Japanese major by US troops near Hollandia. It was then widely published in Australian and US media, but Siffleet was misidentified as Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton VC of No. 22 SQN RAAF, who wore a blue cricket cap into combat, was known as ‘the Firebug’ for his skill and determination in attacking ground targets, and had once said that ‘The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one.’

He had been awarded the Victoria Cross partly for actions on March 16th 1943, when he had pressed on with a bombing attack on Salamaua, New Guinea, despite his aircraft sustaining major damage, then conducting a second attack before returning to base. Attacking Salamua again two days later, his aircraft was shot down. Sergeant Basil Eastwood was killed, but Flight Lieutenant Newton and Flight Sergeant John Lyon survived. They received help from New Guineans, but were captured by Japanese naval troops. 

The commander of Japanese naval forces in the area, Ruitarao Fujita ordered Flight Sergeant Lyon to be murdered with a bayonet. Uichi Komai murdered Flight Lieutenant Newton on March 29th, 1943. His body was then mutilated. He was 23 years old. He is now buried in the Lae War Cemetery in New Guinea.

Komai was killed in the Philippines soon afterwards, and Fujita killed himself in 1945.

Sergeant Leonard Siffleet’s body was never found, but he is honoured at the Lae War Cemetery along with all other Commonwealth fallen of the New Guinea campaign with no known graves.

Remember Sergeant Leonard Siffleet, Sergeant Thjis Staverman, Private H. Pattiwal, Private M. Reharing, Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton VC, Sergeant Basil Eastwood, Flight Sergeant John Lyon, the New Guineans who risked their lives to help the downed airmen, and all the other Allied troops and local supporters who defended the world from Japanese imperialism.",Cybermat4707,2024-12-15,5256,Historycord

I delivered revenge like a Disney princess ,"Came here because of The Click. So, here in my block we have this neighbor who is just the combination of every bad neighbor habit. To make things more visual, we're mainly talking about half a block here, the majority of the houses are two stories, except the one in the middle that is a car detailing and accessories store, so this store's roof, makes every house on this half block visible to each other. 

So, the major complaint is the noise, this guy blasts trash music all day long, which would not be a problem if this guy respected the volume and time allowed. Everyone in the block has called the police because of the noise after 12am at least once. When my family called the police (at 3am) the police told us that the sound had already exceeded the permitted decibels since before the street began. But I guess money is not a problem for this guy, because he keeps doing it. Since everybody was calling the police on him because of the noise, he decided to call the police because of the noise... Of a newborn baby crying (when the policemen arrived they told the guy to fuck off, so that was a mini-win).

Besides, this guy's also a creep, that keep staring through every window. The majority of the neighbors had installed tinted windows or curtains because of this particular guy. I literally couldn't enjoy sunlight because this dude kept staring at my window whenever my underaged sister was on the room.

Obviously there's more, but this were the major complaints. Cue the revenge.

Since this dude is used to be awake during the night blasting terrible music, he sleeps basically all morning, and absolutely hates birds chirping because it wakes him up. You can literally hear him complaining and closing the windows when the birds start singing. So I decided to plan based on that.

I asked every neighbor if they were ok with the birds chirping. The majority said they love it. Then I asked the detailing store if I could scatter some seeds on their roof to attract birds. The owner said ABSOLUTELY YES, because the guy threw  trash at the store's roof, so every single week the owner had to clean the gutters.

So I started scattering the seeds everyday at 5am ok the store's roof, and in less than 1 week, I have a full army of birds. I also started putting things like leaves, twigs, dog hair, and other things so the birds could build nests nearby. In my window there's also water for the birdies.

Now, the most delicious part of my revenge, was when I decided the birds needed a little treat. I have a friend that breeds insects for people to feed their exotic pets, so I asked him for 100 crickets to feed the birds. He gave me an amazing discount and the next day, I was also scattering crickets in that roof. The birds started eating the crickets, but obviously they couldn't eat them all, so the rest of the dozens of crickets that scaped, ran to the nearest shelter.... The idiot's open balcony.

You may think ""couldn't he just kill the birds or something?""... Well, he tried, but the odds are in our favor, because the birds that come chirping on his windows are PROTECTED BY AMBIENTAL LAW, so if he tries to harm them, he'll pay a much more expensive fine then the sound pollution one.

Now, my block is the only place in the ghetto where you can wake up everyday like a Disney princess, with more than 30 birds chirping, and the sounds of a very distressed evil neighbor. ",japaneseCrying,2024-08-01,5182,pettyrevenge

TIFU when I saw my ex,"This is more of a personal embarrassment. I ran into an ex today. And I don’t mean recent. I mean like decades ago. Haven’t seen this person since our break up back when we were really young.

At the time, it was my first love, and I didn’t handle the break up well. I didn’t do anything super crazy like boil bunnies. Just called and left tearful messages on the answering machine. Obviously I’ve moved on, been married, had kids. But there is a place that your first love will always hold. 

Apparently…I was not their special first love. 

First of all, I was at a place where I’d gone with that ex at the time. It’s a popular place that I’ve been to before and since, but for some reason I remembered today the time we carved our initials in a tree. I didn’t even look at the tree. Just remembered it for a second.

You know, it must have been that phenomenon where you randomly think of someone before you see them. Because a few minutes later… there they were. Being the idiot I am, I thought it would be a friendly run in. Like “hey! Long time no see!”

First…they didn’t know who I was until I said my name. Then for some stupid reason I said “I was just thinking about you.”

Crickets. Disbelief. Me backpedaling and saying that we went to this place together a lot, and they did not remember at all. 

Omg. I always thought if I ever saw this person again that I would be cool. Not stick my foot in my mouth. Not sound like a crazy stalker. Now of course I keep playing it on repeat in my mind and cringing every time.

[Original Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/qbr43e/should_i_sue_my_girlfriend_for_selling_my_stuff/)  **Oct 20, 2021** 

We are both in our early twenties and have been together for 3 years. It has been 2 months since we moved in together. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with collecting pokemon cards; I had over 5000 cards in my collection. A lot of them are very crappy, worth 0.5c to $3, but some are worth up to 250$. Personally, I never intended to sell them or at least not in the near future. My girlfriend gave away my entire collection to her cousin 1 month ago without asking me since he asked her if he could have them when he visited us. She gave them away, believing that since I'm an adult now, I won't need them. As I was cleaning my room a few hours ago, I realized my collection box was missing and I went crazy looking for it. An hour later she came home after running some errands and told me what she did. I told her to get all of them back, and she has refused because it would be humiliating for her. What should I do? I have a recording of her confessing to it so I can easily get compensated for it in court, but I'm assuming that will effectively end the relationship. Though I love her a lot, I believe I would rather have my cards. It doesn't seem right to sue her for this, but I don't know how I can recover my collection. If there is a less aggressive way to handle this, please let me know. Advice?

>>>They are worth 5-5.5k in terms of today's value and more importantly, they have sentimental value to me and I'm pretty sure that's something. One other commentator suggested this is something the police would be able to handle so there is no need for any court so first I will try that and hopefully I get them back. 

>>>Thank you for mentioning how expensive that could be so I'll def keep it as a last resort. 

**OOP Also added** 

>>>The small claims court can only award me up to 1000$ (equivalent to my currency) which is not the monetary value of the cards. There is also sentimental value which is worth way more. 

>>>My sister is a lawyer and she said since the monetary value is huge, the police will get involved and treat it as a serious matter. 

>>>I have given her time to think about it but if she doesn't do anything I'll go and file an FIR against her and the cousin since I won't have any other option at that point. 

[Update](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rey2e3/update_should_i_sue_my_girlfriend_for_selling_my/)  **Dec 12, 2021 (2 months later)** 

Holy shit. Never thought this is how 2021 would end. A lot has happened since my first post. First, thank you for the support, some tips, and good luck. 

I'll start by clearing some assumptions. In my original post I said though ""Though I love her a lot, I believe I would rather have my cards"". This statement alone pissed some of you, so let me elaborate on that. My first ever 300 cards were from my father's collection. He died of hepatitis C. He was quite into gaming. My mum kept his cards for years and gave them to me when I was in my early teens and I got hooked. I grew the collection to 5000 cards. There was immense sentimental value attached to those cards. 

After my GF refused to talk to the cousin, he refusing to give me the cards when I asked, his parents being jerks to me, I took the legal route. Filed an FIR. Initially, I had trouble since the police didn't care about some cards but my sister, who is a lawyer (She is about to become a lawyer) told the police the estimated value and they got interested. We told the police 5 to 5.5k value of the cards. Things took time, but the police eventually confiscated the cards (4987) and got them appraised by a company. They came back with a value of approximately 6000$. I told the police the missing cards were also of substantial value since they were very old (Son of bitch sold the one my father left behind). Cousin told us who he sold to, and those people gave the cards back with no problems. Right now, the police have all the cards. The cousin who I knew had his eyes on my cards threw my GF under the bus. I know this because he wanted to buy those from me in the past, but I refused. He told the police he bought those in good faith. My GF also tried lying to the police, but since I had her on recording, she got into even more trouble. 

She got charged with grand larceny and also fined for lying to the police. 

I should get the cards by the end of this month or by early January. The police just said they need to finalize and file some reports and then I can have them. 

As for proof of all this, I had the cards photos front and back, along with some receipts. 

Some of you were also saying that I should take this to small claim court. This amount is too big for that, at least where I am. 

EDIT: I forgot to add my sister wants to sue all of them for emotional distress but I don't about that. Any advice on that? 

TLDR; She got arrested; the cousin got some ass whooping in front of me and I have almost got my cards back.

One time, a man at work asked me to set a meeting, so I started sharing my screen and offered to show him how, and he said “oh no, I know how” so I stopped sharing and said “great, so if you have any questions setting that meeting just let me know” 

He never asked me to set a meeting for him again. 

Most recently last week, in a meeting I’m telling the programmers “all of these types of tickets need to need to be peer reviewed” I said it TWICE, then at the end of the meeting this guy asks what he needs to do, I tell him again, and he asks me to make a list of the numbers and send it to them. I said “if you filter for this, this, and this, all of these tickets will be there” 

*crickets* for almost a full 2 minutes, until I put myself on mute, then he finally says “okay” 

I can’t. I used to be really willing to help out, but I’m done helping people who make more than me, have the same job title as me, and do less work. ",krazycitty69,2024-12-12,4984,womenintech

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control. 

##**NEW UPDATE**

[I'm working on me now...](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/wAcOx7vYug)  **Nov 18, 2024**

It's been a month since I finally was able to share the success of my divorce from Alex. My mood swings are still happening, but they don't last quite as long anymore so I'm taking that as a good sign. My therapist recommended that I sign up for some kind of physical activity, just to help work out and channel what she called the fight/flight instincts more. So I've joined a local self-defense club and I'm going twice a week. I felt really awkward in the beginning, but they've all been super nice and welcoming so it's been easier. It has helped I think, a lot of my jitteriness and anxiety has calmed and I'm sleeping better as well. 

I've also joined a book club, though it's all online at the moment, they're discussing the possibility of meeting in person rather than over skype at a local park. It's hard, honestly. I feel like a kid that just changed schools and sometimes feel like it's either sink or swim. My therapist pointed out that if I feel like I'm sinking to stop, take a step back and remind myself that I have all the control over my actions - if I don't like something I don't have to do it. I can feel my emotions but I also need to not let them control and dictate my actions. She also pointed out how I've developed a tendency to try and fix other people's bad moods. She told me that they're adults, and it's not my responsibility to manage anyone else's emotions other than my own.

It's been hard. But... I'm getting there. I think in a year, as a celebration for my divorce, I may go visit my grandmother's grave. Just to talk if nothing else as silly as that may sound. 

I passed on your thanks to my lawyer, who smiled and said - a bit smugly I might add - that he loves giving people who thought they were untouchable the karma they deserved. He went on to add that he enjoyed being 'Karma's helping hand'. My lawyer has kept abreast of what's been happening with Alex and his sister both, just to make sure they don't try anything. According to him, my ex-sil threw a fit when she was let go from the DV center, enough that she was barred from the premises. It seems that she shares some traits with her brother in regards to temper. She's now working at Lowes apparently, as while she was a volunteer at the DV center, she has to pay some fines for damages she caused during the incident that got her banned.

As for Alex, he's been quiet which worried me at first. But my lawyer told me he's keeping his head down. He's gotten another job with a construction crew, but with everything he has to pay, he cannot afford to lose his job. I was awarded damages for emotional distress and harm, as he never touched me physically. I was able to prove my statements thanks to records of the text conversations between Alex and I regarding the tracker and not leaving the house without permission. As my financial situation is stable, I don't need Alimony, so my Lawyer advised not to try for it and focus on compensation for damages in stead. Alex's family apparently hates me now, as they've reached out to my lawyer, telling him to pass on the message that I've successfully ruined both Alex and his sister's lives over my 'lies'. Honestly, at this point... I'm getting to the point of not caring anymore. I only have so much to give right now for emotional needs and I want it for my own, not to expend on someone else if that makes any kind of sense. 

So that's where I'm at right now. It's hard, coming up to the holidays and being alone but a few weeks ago, I found a kitten in the alley next to my work. He's a tiny, raggedy little thing. He's black, long hair with three white paws and he's also missing his tail. He's got the first vertebrae but nothing else. According to the vet, mom may have accidently bitten it off at birth... which I didn't even know happened but apparently it does. I'm calling him Bandit. So I'm not alone anymore, but now I have a kitten that thinks EVERYTHING needs to be hunted... including my toes to I wear slippers constantly cause those little claws of his are like freaking daggers I swear. I'll update again if anyone wants me to, but yeah... that's where things are now.

[My (30 F) spouse (35 M) has been acting incredibly strange. Do I need to help him or do I need to escape?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e3g53w/my_30_f_spouse_35_m_has_been_acting_incredibly/) July 14, 2024

Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile and I’m really shaken up as I write this.
My (30F) spouse (35M) has been experiencing behaviour that has only become increasingly concerning. In the past two months now, he has been talking about things that he claims are happening but he’s never mentioned before.

As some background info, when his behaviour first starting getting concerning, I managed to convince him to go the hospital to get checked out for his mental health. He wasn’t even seen by a doctor and he was told he just needs to take a certain medicine to help him sleep. The issue is he also smokes weed so this medicine does not mix well with that. He won’t quit smoking. We also have two very young kids.

Back to the weird recent behaviour, he claims he had an old email with an inheritance that got hacked and he needs access to it. I tried helping him get on it but he hasn’t used it in literally the 12 years we’ve been together, I only knew of its existence previously when I helped him switch his Facebook login and that was an email attached. Another example is that he believes everyone is talking about him to me and everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. He thinks there’s some sort big thing planned to hurt him or do something horrible to him soon and that we’re all on it.

On a few other separate occasions he’s asked about a “show” that “we’re on” and asked how much money I’m being paid to keep a secret. He also thinks I’m having secret phone calls and that I’ve apparently left the room to accept these calls, which then results in me coming back crying about something I’ve apparently discussed on the phone.
Whenever I try to explain to him that none of this is happening, he fights back saying that I’m just lying to him and to tell him the truth. That I need to tell him the truth or something bad is going to happen.

It’s gotten so bad, he ended up getting fired from his job because he was barely showing up. He kept going to the cop station to make a report instead of going to work. After he got fired there was some sort of tense situation where they ended up calling a wellness check for him, because they were afraid he’s going to come back and hurt someone. The cops showed up while I was also home and he said he wouldn’t hurt someone, he only acts in defense.
In the recent weeks, he’s gone from screaming at me demanding answers to just not talking to me at all. At this point I’d rather he just not interact with me.

The reason I’m writing this is because of what happened today. It was a nice day out and I asked if he would come with me for a walk with our kids, to which he agreed to. He barely spoke a word to me or the kids on this walk, and when we came across a playground, I asked if we should take the kids there for a few minutes of play. He then got upset at me for suggesting it and said I always control everything and I’m the “queen of the decisions”. I didn’t even tell him we were doing that, I just asked. When I mentioned this he just said “do whatever you want, like always”, so I figured why not. So I played with the kids at the playground and he did his own thing. Someone left a couple various balls there and he was throwing them around. He then picked up the football and threw it in my direction, it flew past me a couple feet from me. I asked why he did that and he said “why are you upset, it didn’t hit you” to which I responded “well what if it did?” He then said “if I wanted it to hit you in the head I would have thrown it that way”. Then he started on a rant about how he’s going through the same thing with everyone lying to him. After which he sat down in the corner of the park and was doing literally nothing.

I was getting upset, so I packed up the kids and started walking to leave the park. I said to him “we’re going home” and started walking away. Apparently he tried to yell out to us but ended up taking a different way home than we did. He told me this when he met me on the street when we were almost home, saying that “next time I want to be an idiot and walk away maybe stop and listen for him calling out”. I didn’t hear him but honestly he could have easily caught up to us.

I was getting more and more upset and said I wanted to go for a drive to get coffee and he said fine. I said I wanted to take the kids and he asked why. Then I said fine, you stay home with them and he said no they can go with you and started putting them in the car. I got in the car, and he got in the passenger seat, to which I asked him if he’s coming with. He said yes and to drive. I told him I didn’t want him coming with because he’s being mean and he said he could be a lot meaner. As I started driving away he kept going off on the usual BS he’s been talking about lately and I told him I don’t want to hear it, he started screaming at me to keep driving and shut the fuck up. I stopped the car and told him to get out and he made a motion like he was going to punch me but punched his hand in front of my face. At this point I started crying and yelling at him to get out and he yelled back no just drive. I then said I should just drive him to the police station for that and he said he would choke me unconscious before we even got there. I was crying even more at this point and said I don’t want to be with him anymore and I want him out, he said no. He continued to be a dick for the rest of the car ride, where I pleaded with him to not treat me this way, especially in front of our children. It’s not fair to them, or to me. He said to not bring them into this. I said how couldn’t I, they are literally in the car!

Anyway after I drove us home, he asked how long I’ve been waiting to break up with him and who I’m replacing him with. I told him I haven’t been and there’s no one else, which of course he doesn’t believe. When he got inside he even taunted me saying “I should take you to the cop station” in a girly voice.

He’s outside smoking and I’m inside with the kids writing this. Of course I’m shook up currently but I don’t know what to do. We only have the one vehicle which is in both our names, the place we rent is actually my moms so we don’t have a lease but we both have our addresses attached to this place on our licenses. He wasn’t always like this, literally only the past couple months his behaviour has been this bad. I miss the person he used to be, I miss that he would spend time with me, with the kids, but he spends all his time by himself now. I don’t know if he’s going through some sort of manic episode or what’s triggering this change in behaviour but I really don’t know what to do.
Is there something differently I can do to help him? Every time he talks to me about whatever “situation” he doesn’t accept any answer I say and also won’t accept if I say nothing.
EDIT: I just wanted to update and let you all know we are safe. I’m sorry for not saying anything sooner. I’m a bit overwhelmed with how popular this post got and will give an actual update later.

Thank you for the advice and comments as well. I will mention a couple things —

* we are not in the US

* where we are, marijuana is legal, so my spouse does get it from government run dispensaries. I don’t think there’s a chance his stuff gets laced aside from the fact he mixes cigarettes with it.

* a lot of people mentioned meth. There is just no way. He doesn’t go anywhere random, he doesn’t talk to people outside of our household (aside from the few times he would go to the police station). I have his location on his phone so I can see where he goes when he leaves.

>I just wanna say, I was that terrified kid in the back seat. Absolutely traumatizing. My mom always came up with an excuse as to why we couldn’t leave the house or leave dad. Made me suffer for many years of my life and I’m 28 years old trying to deal with the trauma it has given me. Please stop making excuses and leave. Get OUT for the kids. My mom never did and it truly has ruined my mental health.

**CoraCricket**:

>Wow this is way more urgent than everyone seems to be acting. Are you able to sneak yourself and your kids out right now while he's smoking? You could start by going to the police station and telling them what's going on, they should hopefully be able to connect you to resources for families fleeing domestic abuse. If you have someone you can stay with, then that makes it easier but either way do not spend another night in that house with him and definitely don't let your kids around him unsupervised. 

>If you can't sneak out I would call 911, tell them what just happened and about his threats, and that you need to get out but that you are afraid for you and your children's safety. They are not always the most helpful but something needs to happen. At least then if he comes back in and tries to do something to you you'll be in the phone with them and they can send someone then. Might be a good strategy while your leaving too if you're worried he might catch you. 

>It sounds like he's having some kind of psychological break, the paranoia and being convinced everyone is part of some conspiracy against him is not abnormal there. But he has clearly told you that he is a danger to you so you need to worry about that first, get yourself and your kids to safety and figure the rest out after that. Once it's time to deal with him and his situation, depending on where you are, getting him involuntarily detained for psychiatric treatment requires proving he's a danger to himself or others, so at least you can show how he's threatened you. But worry about that after you and your kids are safely away from him.

**daddy_tywin**:

>Heavy cannabis use can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in people who are already susceptible. Your H is right about the age where this tends to happen in men. I am not a doctor but I really think this is a mental health emergency, either due to a drug interaction, drug use itself, or because he is rapidly developing a psychotic disorder.
>You need to see a mental health professional, NOT the ER, and describe all of this behavior to them including the frequency of his marijuana use.

**OOP**:

>>That’s the thing, he saw a crisis nurse at the hospital and a therapist/social worker there, and I felt like the only thing they tried to do was get him to take a specific medication. I think it’s called quetiapine or something. But anyway, I don’t think he is regularly taking it and if he is he definitely shouldn’t be mixing it with smoking weed.

**daddy_tywin**:

>>>That’s the generic for seroquel, which is actually an antipsychotic medication used for schizophrenia and bipolar I episodes. That makes way more sense to be prescribed than a sleeping pill. You’re right though he needs to be taking it as RX’d (bottle should have the dosing on it). I looked up the drug interactions and the ones listed are moderate and mostly physical although generally people with any kind of psychotic disorder I think are not supposed to use marijuana.

**Mama_Odie**:

>Just call the police for assistance to leave. If you have somewhere to go, it’s that easy. I’ve done it. He’ll put a good front on but you need to tell them you are in fear of your life because he threatened you STRANGLE you. You can’t wallow and be a scary baby. Not in front of your kids. He traumatized them enough. You can also have him removed for the threats on your life and you can change locks. Do not let another day pass in this.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e8e36p/update_my_30_f_spouse_35_m_has_been_acting_strange/) July 20, 2024

Hello, first of all thank you all for the comments, messages, etc. on my previous post. Obviously it got a bit too much to keep up with responding but I just want to say I really appreciate the help. A TL;DR at the bottom.
To give an update, I left the house the night I made the post, but went back home the following day. I wanted to be able to collect some sort of evidence I could use, because my spouse has been really good at downplaying his symptoms to any authority figure. I want to mention that I had been present at most doctor and hospital visits prior, so I know what they did recommend for him. I felt at the time that they did not give him enough help for the crisis he was obviously going through.

Anyway, continuing on, the couple days after the Sunday post, he did not really engage in much conversation with me or our children. Every time he entered the room, I set my phone to record. I did not get anything until Thursday, when he finally started talking to me again. He was questioning who I have been talking to about him and who has been trying to sabotage his life. Obviously I denied everything, because there is no one talking to me about him (aside from this Reddit post, which he didn’t know about). This started to anger him, which included him yelling at me and saying if anyone is talking to me about him, to bring him to the house so he can “take care of them himself”.

I tried to not to engage any more. This made him more upset, as he was continuing to demand answers from me. He would then say “oh I want to hit you” or “don’t make me slap you” when I was either not answering or just saying I didn’t know what he was talking about. I got this on recording. After he ended up walking away and leaving the room, I took the kids to bed, locked us in our room and tried to sleep.

The following morning, he insisted on driving me to work. I told him I wanted the car, to which he disagreed with me and said he needed it. After dropping out kids off, he started going off on me about how I am stupidity, dumb, a bitch, etc. for keeping his “inheritance” (again something he is clearly having delusions about) from him. I tried to disengage completely, keeping myself to far side of the passenger seat, which caused him to grab me by the back of my neck and pull me closer to him, where he told me to listen to him. I obviously reacted to this and was super upset, telling him to please focus on driving and not touch me again.

After he drove me to work, the last thing I said to him as he was still going off on me with the car window open, was “you desperately need help”. Once I got in, I called my boss and let her know what happened. She came in, cancelled her appointments for the day, and took me to the police station.

We made a report, although the sergeant we initially spoke to seemed to be against us making a report (he kept saying he will be homeless if I report him, like he’s the victim in this scenario). I told him my safety and the kids safety should be more important, and he brought in a different officer to make the statement with me. Once I completed that statement, they let me know to stay away from the house as they were going to arrest him, and will call once he’s out of the house.

About 5 hours later, he was arrested. Apparently he was very compliant, and with all the information I provided, they actually took him to the hospital, and he is currently on a 30 day psychiatric hold. He will be going to court at some point for uttering threats and assault, but seeing how he doesn’t have a criminal record, I’m sure it will just end up being a slap on the wrist.

So as of now, I am home, safe with the children, and we are getting our locks changed. I will also most likely get a protection order, but in an ideal world, he gets better and that’s not necessary. I guess we will see in the future.
I want to again thank every one for their comments and assistance. A lot of you made some excellent points, and although I know some of my decisions probably seemed like dumb ones, I was trying to figure out the best solution logistically for us. Any other future updates will be on my profile.

TL;DR: he was arrested yesterday and put on a psych hold. I’m okay physically but not emotionally.

>Good luck OP

**saturatedregulated**:

>I dealt with something similar, but thankfully not with a romantic partner and we shared no assets or children. It was terrifying, and I still am affected by it daily. 

>My friend ended up being diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder (paranoid schizophrenia). He did really well on meds. Actually, so well that he stopped believing he had an issue and stopped taking the meds. His latest bout of mania legitimately scared me and I had to remove myself. 

>Your husband is starting a very long road, and a lot of mentally ill people struggle with keeping straight down that long road. I'm not saying you should remove him from your life, but I am saying you have the best chance of healing and raising unaffected adults if you do remove him. Your love for him and the family you've built cannot sustain mental illness, and love is not all you need. Sometimes it becomes way bigger than you and the kindest thing you can do is bow out.

>I'm really sorry you're all in this situation. 

**shame-the-devil**:

>Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family. The problem with your husband is that he’s already become more violent, and it will likely get worse if you let him return to the home. I have seen family members get better on medication, only to make the decision to stop medicating bc they no longer believed they were ill. Over. And over and over. I have also seen them act normally in front of others, which made it difficult to even get them help in the first place.

>One of my family members attempted to murder their caregivers. They almost succeeded.
>Another attempted to murder a person they thought was real, but who was actually a hallucination.

>You are not safe. Your children are not safe. And you are not taking this seriously enough.

**RaiseIreSetFires**:

>I'm very proud of you for taking the first step towards a new healthy life for your kids and yourself. To continue on this path you need to quit hoping for the best and start preparing for the worst. It's a long road but, you've shown the intelligence and fortitude to successfully see this through.

>That being said, I'm going to have to stress to you that he's not going to ""get better"" in 30 days.

>Get that restraining order ASAP. One reason is he will be served while in custody, instead of you having to track him down to serve him. Second reason, they look at how quickly you do these things when he goes to court for the charge. It shows you are actually going to follow through and the seriousness of your situation. Third reason is he is more likely to be charged for DV and threats. Fourth reason is it will usually make custody and separation move faster.

>This is one of those situations where shit in one hand and hope he miraculously becomes mentally healthy in 30 days in the other, which fills up quicker?
>Good luck and don't stray from your path to safety and happiness.

**OOP**:

>>Thank you, it’s definitely wishful thinking that he will get the treatment needed to go back to normal. I don’t want to think of this as the end of our relationship but at the same time I don’t know if he would want to be back with me since I got him detained.

>>Right now the only thing I’m thinking about are the kids.

**noonecaresat805**:

>Make sure as soon as the protection order is in place to let the school know that he isn’t allowed to take the kids out. Find a theraphy place for you and the kids and have them help you explain to them that it’s not safe to talk to dad at the moment. That way he won’t try to get his revenge through them. And good for you. And your right him ending up homeless is not your concern.

**OOP**:

>>They are toddlers, so a bit too young to understand. Their daycare is aware as well.

**noonecaresat805**:

>>>I work in a daycare and unless we have a restraining order on paper of the other parent shows up we have to release their child to them. There’s nothing we can do. And children are smarter than you give them credit for. Just because they can’t say everything doesn’t mean they don’t notice everything

**emmaa5382**:

>I think something to note is to keep a close eye on your kids in their early 20s and teach them the signs. It could be hereditary but with enough foreknowledge can be caught early and treated

**emccm**:

>I too dealt with something similar. Use this time to get the divorce started. Have a plan. When the 30 day hold is up you will get immense pressure from doctors, social workers and family to take him back. Repeat variations “I do not feel safe with him on the home”, “I fear for my safety when he is around” over and over. They will try to convince me you he’s fine because they can’t release him without somewhere to go.

>Use this time to get legal advice. Use an attorney with experience with mentally ill spouses. Try and get a restraining order for you and the kids.

>I know you have a lot going on. You have to act. Thr first time my ex was hospitalized I listened and took him back. He was livid and blamed me for what happened to him. The second time he was hospitalized I was lucky to walk away with my life. Act now. You have kids to think about.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Manufacturer_620/comments/1gwajtx/update/) (Posted on their profile) November 21, 2024

I don’t know if anyone will even see this.

It’s been awhile since I updated. I still get messages asking how I am and to update again. I apologize in the delay, but I’ve been a bit deterred from making another post due to coming across a TikTok video of one of those AI voices reading my post over a Minecraft video. If one of those channels decides to post this one, please don’t. But if you do anyway, blah blah blah blah blah, we can’t make our own unique content.

Anyway, onto the actual update:

My spouse is doing a lot better. He received the treatment he needed in the psych ward of the hospital, gets a shot every so often instead of taking pills, and only smokes cigarettes now. He’s back to his normal self, engages in conversation with myself and our children like he did before this crazy shit happened, has a job, and honestly, is being a better partner overall. It took a lot of time for me to feel like I could trust him again, but we’ve taken a lot of time to work on things and get back to how we should be.

I know a lot of people wanted me to leave and never look back. But you have to realize how he acted in my initial post was nothing like how he is as a person. Obviously he had some sort of weird psychosis happening, which could have been a result of a high intake of marijuana, plus a couple added stressors. I don’t want to go into too many details because it will give away where we are, but basically something traumatic happened under 10 years ago that happened again a month before he started acting strange. It was one of those types of events that forces you out of your home for undetermined amount of time. Anyway, that’s all the detail I want to go into that. Obviously he was affected by it more than I thought, because when this event happened, I was the one having a difficult time and he was my rock. But after we were able to go back home and have some normalcy, that’s when things started changing for him.

It started with him randomly needing to gain access into an old email, to thinking he was being recorded all the time like he was on the Truman show or something, to thinking that everyone (including me) was out to get him. This is when the threats of violence started happening.

I was obviously in disbelief because in the entire time we’ve been together, nothing like this has ever happened. I never once felt like I was unsafe. I never felt scared. Until the threats continued to come, and he started to escalate.

After he made excellent progress in the hospital and I had many reassuring conversations with the psychiatrist, I allowed him to come home when he was discharged. It was so hard not having him around, I cried all the time, our kids really missed their dad, and he really missed us. He needed to get help, and I’m so thankful I was able to find an effective solution.

This will most likely be my last update. I don’t really think I’ll need to add any other details, but again, I just want to thank everyone for their messages and comments, even the ones who called me an idiot lol.

He should've been booked as dominating force, especially since it's his last Rumble and make it mean something (For Example: HBK during his last Rumble). 

I've been a lifelong John Cena fan and I was just disappointed how he conducted himself in the ring. It didn't seem like anyone took him seriously in the match. 

Now, I do understand it's his last Rumble and he was trying to have fun, but his promo on the first Raw in Netflix made it seem like he was hungry and would give all his might to winning.

**I [36F] met my Ex-husband [38M/F] (together 2 years; divorced for 5) at my friends Xmas Party. Now he wants to reconnect & I'm unsure**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!victim blaming!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/pSjB2peCOz)  **Dec 27, 2017**

As the title states, I went to my best friends' Xmas/her husbands birthday party on the 24th and met my Ex there, for the first time since our divorce. Apparently he is one of my bff husbands' co-workers. He didn't know that I would be there and was as surprised as I was. We made some smalltalk and then I hopped over to Chat with another friend. During the evening we bumped into eachother a couple of times, he made some jokes, but most of the time I tried to avoid him. Yesterday my best friend sent me a screenshot in which my Ex asked her husband for my number (in case I wanted him to have it) because he wanted to ask me out.

Thing is, nobody in this city knows that we we're once married to each other. When I moved here 5 years ago from the other side of the country, I never mentioned my divorce. He didn't either. So now my friend & her husband want to hook us up, because""you seemed to have such great chemistry at the party"".


The other thing is that I never realised how much I missed him until he entered the room. Our relationship was a mistake, we got married because we were the only unmarried couple in our social circle and everybody else was already having babies. The divorce was ineviatable: our communication was rubbish, I wanted kids, he didn't (at least not as soon as possible), His mum was meddling and he didn't stand up to her.

At the same time we were really good friends and meeting him again made me more than happy. But I had a chat with my cousin (32F) and her husband who are spending Xmas & New Years Eve with me and they told me not to overreact and that being nostalgic for the things that could have been was natural during the holidays.

So now I am debating to meet him, talk to him and be done for good, but the risks of catching feelings again is high (He did look better than 5years ago & finally left his hometown to work for his dream business - something I told him to do years ago). Am I exaggerating/overreacting? What should I do???

  **tl;dr**: Met Ex-husband for the first time in 5 years. He lives in my city now and wants to take me out (His own words).  What TF should I do?

*After posting I really wanted to answer your comments but I got distracted. But I read them, thought about them and applied some.This is what happened:*

Shortly after posting and before answering my best friends message, I ran into my Ex in the supermarket. We had a short talk, everything was collogial and since I did not want to jump to conclusions without talking to him, we went for coffee afterwards. Long story short: we agreed to stay in a friendly level, for our own good (He admitted that he felt extremly sentimental after meeting me the last time, I admitted feeling both giddy and panicky at the same time). He apologised for things he did/didn't do during our marriage (mainly not defending me against his mother, with whom he doesn't have any contact anymore). Then we discussed our friends.

What some people asked in my OP was why I never told my best friend about my (failed) marriage. The reasons is that she might be one of the kindest people I know, but she is quite religious (I'm not) and extremly against divorce. In her eyes you should better sacrifice your happiness for the benefit of the others, so getting a divorce is the cowards way out. It means you don't deserve love. Her MIL treats her like scum, her husband stays quiet because she ""is glad that (MiL) gave her the most important thing in her life"" and rather endures the rants and boundary-stomping. So telling her about my divorce would have resulted in one of two scenarios: a) she'd never talk to me again because I killed the idea of marriage or b) she'd try to get me back with my husband.

Some days ago, one of these scenarios happened. I told her before that I was not interested in giving Ex my number (I already had. Neither her or her husband, my Ex's friend knew.), because I was not looking for a relationship (I actually am not. Last March my last relationship kicked the bucket due to cheating (him) and unwillingness to forgive(me)). She acceptance that and inivited me for brunch the next Saturday (one of our traditions). Sunday comes and my Ex calls me whether I was going to bf's brunch. He got an inivitation. So we were both there, sitting next to each other, Bf and her husband trying their very best to get us interested in eachother. It was like in a very bad movie. Like that scene in ""When Harry met Sally"" when they go on a double date. Subtle remarks in the things we have in common, hints in compatablility, badly masked comments on my unsucessful love life... until BF's husband says: ""As far as I know [my name], she would probably make a great wife. My mom likes her, BF's mom loves her... she's every mothers dream."" And Ex says: ""Well, my mother used to call her That Woman and told me all her short-commings until I believed them. Actually she even admitted to hating her. But in hindsight she really was a great wife."" *Crickets* Ex and I look at eachother and burst out in laughter. Probably due to the pressure and the extreme awkwardness of the situation. BF and husband join in. For a moment they believe Ex made a joke. Then BF says: ""We are so sorry for pressuring you. It's just that we like you both and think you'd make a great couple!"" And Ex takes out his f**%'%ing phone shows them a picture of our wedding day (why the f was that there? Because he had sent me some pictures that my dear ExMIL withholded from me) and says: "" We did. But it did not work out and we're friends now. Who wants to go to the cinema?"" Chaos ensued. Worldviews broke. Bf started crying. BF's husband was flabberghasted. They make us leave to ""readjust"".

 Yesterday I spoke to Bf in the phone and explained everything thoroughly: the abuse by MIL, the arguments, the incompatibilities. The mutal decision to end it. My fear of telling her. She was silently crying for my future. Quote: ""You are already so old and threw away your only chance of happiness. No wonder you don't find love. You threw it away. It won't come back. Your future with Ex is riddled by betrayal, If you get back together, you can never mend what you tore apart. What will you tell any partner? I cannot understand how you could do that! You always seemed so compassionate, why could you not understand the pain of your MAIL.She lost her son to you. You did not respect her wishes and did not listen to her.I'm sure she loved you like a daughter but you were not ready."" That's when I said goodbye, have to go, see you and questioned my 5 year friendship. I talked to my mom, to my cousin and even to my Ex (who had a similar but not as emotional talk with BF's husband who doesn't even talk to him at work anymore.) They all recommend that I should give BF some space. I feel worse than after my last breakup.


Soooooo **tl;dr**: am friendly with my Ex now (planning to go to a Pub quiz next Friday with some other friends who have been told about our status), but my best friend is deeply sad about my inability to ""cherish marriage"", insulted me by siding with my abusive Ex MiL and is now in Time-out. Not sure how/whether to save this friendship. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**NDaveT**

>Your ""best friend"" is willing to choose her archaic, destructive views about divorce and marriage over your happiness. I don't think this friendship is worth saving.

**OOP**

>>It seems so. That's so frustrating, we disagreed in so much religionwise, but she was always acctepting/tolerant, just as I was. I never demonized her way of thinking, she never talked down mine-until now. Idk, maybe I'll just write her a nice letter, laying down my disappointment, offering her a chance to talk if she wants to and then slowly end things. Jeez, my divorce was easier.

**CloudOrigami**

>>>But would you *really* want to after the way she made you feel? She was really shitty to you over that phone call regardless of her views. Sorry this has happened to you OP, you deserve better than that -hugs-

**OOP**

>>>>Thanks. *Hugs back* you're right. I'll write a letter anyway, just to let it all out. Will cut contact and just hand her the letter if she confronts me. God, that feels like highschool all over again.

**Edit**: after reading all of your comments I decided to end the friendship. I did not sleep well, so I spent all night writing down what bothered me, so that, if she dares to talk to me again, I have the right arguments. Regarding her possible frustration/projection: I really acted as her therapist for the whole 5 years of our friendship and realize now how co-dependent and slightly toxic this relationship actually was. This is something I have to get over and though I'm a rather introverted social mess, I really need to look out for new friends who are not as prejudiced. (I told one of my colleagues the cliffsnote version of the conflict and she -divorced and remarried- told me to join her feminist knitting and sewing group, so yay, first step!)

Ex has a similar problem now, my friend's husband told their mutual friend group that Ex had ""loose morals"" and might be a bad influence. Because this is kindergarten, some of them blocked Ex on social media, some asked him what crime he commited and only one told him that a) BF's husband is extremly overreacting and b) He still wants to hang out with Ex no matter what. So we're now in the same ""find friends""-boat. 

My friend's husband actually asked his boss this morning if he could arrange it so that he did not have to share an office with Ex anymore. So yeah, they are also cutting ties. 

And to the comments asking which culture we/they belong to: we're all generic Europeans. Ex-friends are just belonging to a strange christian church (protestant. Not even catholic.)

**Tldr** Mission finding new friends is afoot. Ex-friends behave like toddlers, cementing my decision to severe contact.

**My girlfriend [24 F] wanted ANOTHER pet and I [27 M] said NO.** 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/CSV4iI2Agq)  **Dec 3, 2015** 

I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible... Here we go:


My girlfriend LOVES animals. She is a legal secretary as her job and also works as a small animals specialist on the side. She's worked as a small animals specialist for four years, and after getting her ""real job"" decided to keep her other job FOR FUN. At home we have two dogs and two cats. All are her pets. 


Her jobs are highly demanding and when she isn't working, she's in the den organizing huge dog adoption events. Every four or five months she manages to bring about sixty dogs up from high kill shelters around the US and finds every dog a home. And I think that's a cool thing she does but she literally stays up until 3 am planning flights and managing people to get the dogs securely to the holding center and ect... And then wakes up at 6 am and goes to work until 5 pm and then goes to her other job until 10 pm and comes home and repeats the process. On her days off she is taking her dogs to the park or going on hikes. She lavishes her pets with new beds and the best food and when she is working she has the dogs go to day-care ECT! As you can see, her days are FILLED with animals and I feel like I'm not even apart of this relationship. When she isn't with animals she's reading or doing her own thing... We've been out to dinner together maybe twice in the past month. 


She isn't distance or rude, she always let's me in on what she's doing and asks if I want to help or asks if I want to go to the park with her or on a hike but I don't want to because it's always about the animals and not me.


Anyway, last night before we went to bed she said she was thinking about getting a tree frog to put in the den because she really like the ""calming presence"" they give off. I just think that is the straw that broke the camel's back because I told her that's insane. I told her I'm tired of all the animal stuff she's involved in. I told her she needs to grow up. And I told her absolutely NO to the tree frog idea. At first she was quiet but then she said something about how animals are her passion and what she does isn't stupid and she'll never get tired of animals and that I have my own hobbies too that she doesn't think are stupid and childish. She then said that tree frogs and close to nothing maintance wise and they're just pretty. Then she started getting upset and cried and left the room and when I woke up I found her asleep on the living room floor with the dogs.


It's not like we're being overrun with animals but the amount of them in my life is aggravating. She even brings random lizards home and nurses them back to health. Isn't this all a little insane? She's always loved animals but now that she makes a substantial amount of money she does more than ever. I don't get it. Now she wants another animal to fawn over and spend hundreds of dollars on each week?? No! I guess I'm just venting for the most part.


I feel bad for the way she feels but I still think the time she invests in animals is insane and since she's in a relationship with me she should act like it. 

**tl;dr**: girlfriend is obsessed with animals and makes no time for our own relationship. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**simplelogicss** 

>Why would you tell her to grow up? She's is grown up and yes animals are her hobby. She makes time for her hobby. I think you're just resentful because you aren't spending time with her. She has a right to be upset with what you said. 


>Why don't you sit her down and just explain you think her hobby is great but it's time consuming. You would like to spend more time with her and do other things besides doing something animal related. Think of some activities you both haven't experience and not related to your hobbies. Create a hobby you both can do that way you can set some time for it every week. 

**OOP (heavily downvoted)** 

>>I told her to grow up because she's spending thousands of dollars on dogs to fly them from to-and-fro when she could be using that money on homeless children, I mean, if she was that determined to donate (or give away) her money. 

**cursethedarkenss** 

>>>I was with you up until this statement. Who the hell are you to decide what charities are important? There are millions of charities in the US. Is every single one that you don't agree with wrong? Are you the only person in the world who gets to decide what is important? 

>>>Your basic issue with your girlfriend is that she doesn't have enough time for you. That's a perfectly rational reason to break up. But to try to tear down her work that she is so passionate about just makes you look like an immature ass. 

**fluffybunnybutts** 

>>>Then you'd be writing about how your gf is too focused on homeless children and still doesn't pay attention to you. 

**OOP** 

>>>>No. I see the point in donating money to homeless children and actually doing something about it is even cooler. I honestly don't understand why she needs to dedicate so much time to animals. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/F41iO6LQMR)  **Dec 4, 2015 (1 day later)** 

After reading comment after comment about how I didn't support my girlfriend or care about her passions, I started to see where I was wrong. I do care about her passions. I, personally, am burnt out of animal care. I should of communicated that better besides blowing up on her. I still, no matter how many protesting comments I get, will never understand why she donates so much money to JUST animals and not anything else. That was why I told her to grow up. That, and I think her passion for animals *is* childish. Sort of in the way that kids love fairies or mermaids. I feel like it's a phase she never grew out of. I love dogs too but her deep love of animals is something I looked over because she always had good jobs and she is very pretty. I think a lot of people were misguided in calling me a ""douchebag"" simply because I missed spending time with my girlfriend. No, I am not jealous of lizards. I think it's absurd to come home and find her bandaging up some lizard's foot, or open up my fridge to find a tub of mealworms to give said lizard. I've always, always loved how dedicated she was to things. Whatever she's doing, she's giving 100%. I just wish she directed that passion to things that really, really matter. Helping animals is nice and all but it's not really changing the world. 



However I am still deeply in love with the beautiful, sensitive, loving girl I met five years ago, and all the comments made it clear that I was being rude to her. So I wrote her up an apology letter and went to the nearest pet store to get her a tree frog. I got the tank and lamp and even crickets. I set up the whole tank in the den where she wanted it and named the tree frog Jinx. I thought my apology and me buying the tree frog would help her see I care and that her passions are cool.



Anyway. I waited for Jessica to get home and finally when she did, I told her to go look in the den. She seemed upset still and said, ""thank you for the tree frog. I actually bought one before I got off work and had a friend set up the tank for me. It's in my car, I'm gonna go get it. Thank you""



She brought the tank in and asked if we could talk for a little bit in our room because she had some things on her mind. She said she didn't want to jump to conclusions but our relationship wasn't ""heading in the direction she wanted"" and maybe I should find someone more suited to what I like, maybe a more quieter, less busy life. I explained to her that I love her deeply I just want her to tone down her animal life and she said she can't because it's not only her passion but all the money she makes from being an animal specialist goes to the animals for adoption, vet care, housing and money to the people who foster the animals when she can't. She said if she ""toned anything back"" she would lose a huge part of her and I thought she was being extreme. I told her I loved her and if that's her choice. She said she loved me too but my actions showed I can't and wont support her. She then referred to many times in our past when I refused to show up to her adoption events and most memorable for her was when I wasn't there when she was accepting an award. It all became very clear that she didn't want to be with me anymore and once again she was choosing animals over me. I accepted it and told her to live her life as she pleases. I told her that I thought she should give money to homeless children too and she said, ""um, sure.. Do you know any organizations I could help with?"" But I didn't have any suggestions and I was already angry and felt like she was giving me a slap to my face. She said that I was missing the point. We ended the conversation shortly after that with us splitting up and her saying there are things in life that I don't understand, and she can't make me understand and it's just as frustrating for the both of us. I agree with her about the frustration part. 



She said that I can spend as much time as needed to clear my head and I'm allowed to stay here until I find a new place to live. Unfortunately the house is hers, and life is going to be weird to adjust to alone. But she's right that it will be less busy and more quiet, which I'm excited and looking forward to. I am also happy about not having to share my home with a tree frog, her two dogs, and two cats, and whatever other critter she brings home for the night.


**TL:DR**: I tried to apologize to my girlfriend to work things out, but she didn't care at all and then we broke up. She still decided to choose animals over me and that's okay because I'm honestly done too. It was a nice five years.

A bit of background, my MoH is my best friend from high school. For the sake of this post, her name will be Livie. Since the beginning of our friendship I have known about Livie's traumadic background that has caused her to have severe PTSD, anxiety, and depression. I too came from a rough background and we bonded over shared trauma. Livie has a tendency to isolate herself from everyone around her when she is extremely overwhelmed and/or depressed.

About a month and a half before the wedding, she stopped talking to me. After about a week of her not responding, I went over to her house to check in on her. She explained to me what she was going through and I was right there to listen and try to help to the best of my abilities. She kept speaking to me for a few days and then stopped again. I gave her some space, but I needed her to be at a meeting with my wedding manager to go over some fine details for the wedding. She showed up and started speaking again for a few days. 

Then she stops again. I give her some more space because I don't want to overwhelm her even more than she already is. 2 weeks go by and my family hosts a bridal shower for me. She swore that she'd be there. 30 minutes after it starts, I don't here from her. I call her and text her but there is nothing. After I had called her a second time, her boyfriend shows up at the door with a gift. He explains that Livie isn't doing too well today and she's been having extremely bad panic attacks all morning. I let it be and give her the day. 

The next day, we had a meeting set for all the bridesmaids to get together at my home and go over details such as hair, makeup, shoes, times ect for the big day. I had text her all morning trying to see how she was doing and if she would be there tonight. I called her several times through the day with no luck. My fiance, also a good friend of hers, also called her to check in with no luck. 

Finally, about 30 minutes before the meeting was supposed to started, my fiancé calls her bf and tells him that he is on his way to come get her for the meeting. The bf explains that they are actually at a bday party for someone in his family. (BTW the meeting was set up a month prior as to make sure it was set in everyone's schedules.) My fiancé at this point was getting extremely angry and I was having a melt down because another one of my bridesmaids also wasn't responding to me. (The other bridesmaid lost her phone and forgot about the meeting.) Livie went for another week without speaking to me. Exactly 2 weeks before the wedding I sent her this text:

""Hey girl, I understand that you are struggling, but with the wedding 2 weeks away, I really need communication when you need help. I feel like I am losing you, and I don't want that. I love you and I will always be here for you. I need to know that I can count on you too.""

Crickets for the next few days. Yesterday, I tried to call her several times with no answer. So, I went to her home to check in on her. We waited for about 10 minutes outside. We could hear them inside and we called both her and her bf to see if they were okay. Finally I left. I spoke to my wedding manager (who is also my uncle) to get his opinion on it as well as my mother. Both of them said that I only get one wedding day. I need to focus on my happiness right now. They both advised me to send her a text saying that if I don't here from her or her bf by a certain day, I need to move forward. ""The show must go on."" I ended up sending this message to her.

""Hey, I know that you are struggling right now. And if it helps, we can take the responsibility from the wedding off of you and you can be a guest. You are my best friend and I'd love to have you at my wedding, even if it means that you are just a guest. Please let me know by Friday at 7pm if you'd still like to be in the bridal party. If I don't hear from you by then, I will have to move forward and I will see you as a guest at the wedding.""

I really don't want to lose her as a friend, but I really need someone who I can rely on because the wedding is in 9 days.

AITA for threatening to kick my MoH and her partner out of the wedding party? Is there something I could have done better?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I feel like parking outside of her house for 10 minutes trying to get her to talk to you was probably wildly triggering her PTSD.

Did you ever ask her what you could do to make the MOH role fit? Or did you just keep doing the same things and asked her to talk more?

> **OOP:** I have tried to make it clear to her from the start that I do not want to overwhelm her with this responsibility that she has accepted. When I visited her the first time, I asked if she needed any change to her role as MoH, such as if she needed a break from wedding planning for a minute or if she needed any of the other bridesmaids or myself to help her with anything. She told me that she could handle it, and also told me that she would let me know if she needed help.

**Did MOH do anything to help with any of her duties?**

> **OOP:** She helped me make a few decorations for the wedding and I was told that she bought everything for the Bachelorette party, but it was supposed to be this weekend. She kept changing the plans for it and hasn't said anything for 2 weeks about it. At this point I've messaged the other bridesmaids and informed them of what's going on.

**Is it possible that MOH’s boyfriend could be controlling her?**

> **OOP:** I'm not sure. They both have extremely complicated backgrounds and bad trauma. His is honestly worse than hers in some ways. I think that they may be struggling to put two traumatized people in one home, but I honestly don't think they are too healthy for each other.

**OOP on being accused of prioritizing her wedding over MOH’s mental health**

> **OOP:** At this point, it's not just about my wedding but also my mental health as well. Currently, I have a million things going on with my health and everything else. It's not good for me to be crazy stressed because it causes physical issues that can be dangerous. I need someone that I can rely on to help relieve some of this stress from myself. I was trying to give her some space so she didn't feel extremely overwhelmed.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/hLMZf6krR8): **December 10, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

Hello Everyone. It has been a month since mine and my husband's wedding. Everything is going beautifully and we cannot be happier. The wedding was beautiful with only a few hiccups along the way. Another one of my Bridesmaids was extremely helpful to us and stepped in as MoH. She really didn't have to do much except for be at my side, because she is physically unable to do much strenuous activities due to her pregnancy. All of my bridesmaids were beautiful and extremely helpful to me on our big day.

As for Livie, I haven't heard from her since I sent the text letting her know that I needed to hear from her. The day after the ""deadline"" for us to hear from them, I messaged her BF, Dan, directly letting him know that he was still welcome to attend our wedding as a guest. We had a long conversation going back and forth and we ended on good terms.

The next week, we went to a friend's Halloween party where Dan was present. There, he confided in me that Livie was getting too toxic for him and he was going to ask her to move out. From what I have heard, it didn't end well. He was hoping they could stay together, but live separately in hopes of mending their relationship. When she moved out, she had taken his laptop with her, and the last time they spoke, he asked for it back and she pretty much spat in his face. Livie has cut off all contact with what used to be mutual friends which has put a strain on them.

Dan did end up going to the reception and it was nice to see him there. My husband and I speak to him every so often to try and keep touch so he doesn't feel alone in this point in his life.

For those who are wondering, Dan and I spoke about what I could've done to make Livie act in such a way. He told me that she vented to him a lot and told him about how she was fed up with my husband and I, but because he is also a friend, he chose not to listen to much else she had to say about us. The reason he wasn't speaking to us, was to try and save his relationship with Livie.

I have removed Livie as a friend on all social media platforms, but I still have her number saved just incase she ever wants to talk it over. Again, we share trama experiences over s3xual a$$alt and I never want anyone with those experiences to feel alone with they have their times when they are struggling.

Thank you all for your advice from my last post. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You were extraordinarily gracious under pressure and did everything possible to give her every opportunity to be part of your day and all she had to do was maintain some basic decorum but she couldn't do it. You absolutely made the best choice by separating her from her responsibilities and position in the wedding party. So happy to hear you had a wonderful day and hope you have many, many more years after this

**Commenter 2:** I hope he gets his notebook back. But seems so yuck to get it now that she must have done something to damage it.

Congratulations on your wedding. Remember to call your MOH often to ask about her baby and appreciate her more.

> **OOP:** Always. We talk at least once a week. She is such a sweetheart, and she will make a fabulous mother. I am so excited for her and her journeys ahead.

[My (30 F) spouse (35 M) has been acting incredibly strange. Do I need to help him or do I need to escape?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e3g53w/my_30_f_spouse_35_m_has_been_acting_incredibly/) July 14, 2024

Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile and I’m really shaken up as I write this.

My (30F) spouse (35M) has been experiencing behaviour that has only become increasingly concerning. In the past two months now, he has been talking about things that he claims are happening but he’s never mentioned before.

As some background info, when his behaviour first starting getting concerning, I managed to convince him to go the hospital to get checked out for his mental health. He wasn’t even seen by a doctor and he was told he just needs to take a certain medicine to help him sleep. The issue is he also smokes weed so this medicine does not mix well with that. He won’t quit smoking. We also have two very young kids.

Back to the weird recent behaviour, he claims he had an old email with an inheritance that got hacked and he needs access to it. I tried helping him get on it but he hasn’t used it in literally the 12 years we’ve been together, I only knew of its existence previously when I helped him switch his Facebook login and that was an email attached. Another example is that he believes everyone is talking about him to me and everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. He thinks there’s some sort big thing planned to hurt him or do something horrible to him soon and that we’re all on it.

On a few other separate occasions he’s asked about a “show” that “we’re on” and asked how much money I’m being paid to keep a secret. He also thinks I’m having secret phone calls and that I’ve apparently left the room to accept these calls, which then results in me coming back crying about something I’ve apparently discussed on the phone.

Whenever I try to explain to him that none of this is happening, he fights back saying that I’m just lying to him and to tell him the truth. That I need to tell him the truth or something bad is going to happen.

It’s gotten so bad, he ended up getting fired from his job because he was barely showing up. He kept going to the cop station to make a report instead of going to work. After he got fired there was some sort of tense situation where they ended up calling a wellness check for him, because they were afraid he’s going to come back and hurt someone. The cops showed up while I was also home and he said he wouldn’t hurt someone, he only acts in defense.

In the recent weeks, he’s gone from screaming at me demanding answers to just not talking to me at all. At this point I’d rather he just not interact with me.

The reason I’m writing this is because of what happened today. It was a nice day out and I asked if he would come with me for a walk with our kids, to which he agreed to. He barely spoke a word to me or the kids on this walk, and when we came across a playground, I asked if we should take the kids there for a few minutes of play. He then got upset at me for suggesting it and said I always control everything and I’m the “queen of the decisions”. I didn’t even tell him we were doing that, I just asked. When I mentioned this he just said “do whatever you want, like always”, so I figured why not. So I played with the kids at the playground and he did his own thing. Someone left a couple various balls there and he was throwing them around. He then picked up the football and threw it in my direction, it flew past me a couple feet from me. I asked why he did that and he said “why are you upset, it didn’t hit you” to which I responded “well what if it did?” He then said “if I wanted it to hit you in the head I would have thrown it that way”. Then he started on a rant about how he’s going through the same thing with everyone lying to him. After which he sat down in the corner of the park and was doing literally nothing.

I was getting upset, so I packed up the kids and started walking to leave the park. I said to him “we’re going home” and started walking away. Apparently he tried to yell out to us but ended up taking a different way home than we did. He told me this when he met me on the street when we were almost home, saying that “next time I want to be an idiot and walk away maybe stop and listen for him calling out”. I didn’t hear him but honestly he could have easily caught up to us.

I was getting more and more upset and said I wanted to go for a drive to get coffee and he said fine. I said I wanted to take the kids and he asked why. Then I said fine, you stay home with them and he said no they can go with you and started putting them in the car. I got in the car, and he got in the passenger seat, to which I asked him if he’s coming with. He said yes and to drive. I told him I didn’t want him coming with because he’s being mean and he said he could be a lot meaner. As I started driving away he kept going off on the usual BS he’s been talking about lately and I told him I don’t want to hear it, he started screaming at me to keep driving and shut the fuck up. I stopped the car and told him to get out and he made a motion like he was going to punch me but punched his hand in front of my face. At this point I started crying and yelling at him to get out and he yelled back no just drive. I then said I should just drive him to the police station for that and he said he would choke me unconscious before we even got there. I was crying even more at this point and said I don’t want to be with him anymore and I want him out, he said no. He continued to be a dick for the rest of the car ride, where I pleaded with him to not treat me this way, especially in front of our children. It’s not fair to them, or to me. He said to not bring them into this. I said how couldn’t I, they are literally in the car!

Anyway after I drove us home, he asked how long I’ve been waiting to break up with him and who I’m replacing him with. I told him I haven’t been and there’s no one else, which of course he doesn’t believe. When he got inside he even taunted me saying “I should take you to the cop station” in a girly voice.

He’s outside smoking and I’m inside with the kids writing this. Of course I’m shook up currently but I don’t know what to do. We only have the one vehicle which is in both our names, the place we rent is actually my moms so we don’t have a lease but we both have our addresses attached to this place on our licenses. He wasn’t always like this, literally only the past couple months his behaviour has been this bad. I miss the person he used to be, I miss that he would spend time with me, with the kids, but he spends all his time by himself now. I don’t know if he’s going through some sort of manic episode or what’s triggering this change in behaviour but I really don’t know what to do.

Is there something differently I can do to help him? Every time he talks to me about whatever “situation” he doesn’t accept any answer I say and also won’t accept if I say nothing.

EDIT: I just wanted to update and let you all know we are safe. I’m sorry for not saying anything sooner. I’m a bit overwhelmed with how popular this post got and will give an actual update later.

Thank you for the advice and comments as well. I will mention a couple things —

* we are not in the US
* where we are, marijuana is legal, so my spouse does get it from government run dispensaries. I don’t think there’s a chance his stuff gets laced aside from the fact he mixes cigarettes with it.
* a lot of people mentioned meth. There is just no way. He doesn’t go anywhere random, he doesn’t talk to people outside of our household (aside from the few times he would go to the police station). I have his location on his phone so I can see where he goes when he leaves.

>I just wanna say, I was that terrified kid in the back seat. Absolutely traumatizing. My mom always came up with an excuse as to why we couldn’t leave the house or leave dad. Made me suffer for many years of my life and I’m 28 years old trying to deal with the trauma it has given me. Please stop making excuses and leave. Get OUT for the kids. My mom never did and it truly has ruined my mental health.

**CoraCricket**:

>Wow this is way more urgent than everyone seems to be acting. Are you able to sneak yourself and your kids out right now while he's smoking? You could start by going to the police station and telling them what's going on, they should hopefully be able to connect you to resources for families fleeing domestic abuse. If you have someone you can stay with, then that makes it easier but either way do not spend another night in that house with him and definitely don't let your kids around him unsupervised. 

>If you can't sneak out I would call 911, tell them what just happened and about his threats, and that you need to get out but that you are afraid for you and your children's safety. They are not always the most helpful but something needs to happen. At least then if he comes back in and tries to do something to you you'll be in the phone with them and they can send someone then. Might be a good strategy while your leaving too if you're worried he might catch you. 

>It sounds like he's having some kind of psychological break, the paranoia and being convinced everyone is part of some conspiracy against him is not abnormal there. But he has clearly told you that he is a danger to you so you need to worry about that first, get yourself and your kids to safety and figure the rest out after that. Once it's time to deal with him and his situation, depending on where you are, getting him involuntarily detained for psychiatric treatment requires proving he's a danger to himself or others, so at least you can show how he's threatened you. But worry about that after you and your kids are safely away from him.

**daddy_tywin**:

>Heavy cannabis use can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in people who are already susceptible. Your H is right about the age where this tends to happen in men. I am not a doctor but I really think this is a mental health emergency, either due to a drug interaction, drug use itself, or because he is rapidly developing a psychotic disorder.

>You need to see a mental health professional, NOT the ER, and describe all of this behavior to them including the frequency of his marijuana use.

**OOP**:

>>That’s the thing, he saw a crisis nurse at the hospital and a therapist/social worker there, and I felt like the only thing they tried to do was get him to take a specific medication. I think it’s called quetiapine or something. But anyway, I don’t think he is regularly taking it and if he is he definitely shouldn’t be mixing it with smoking weed.

**daddy_tywin**:

>>>That’s the generic for seroquel, which is actually an antipsychotic medication used for schizophrenia and bipolar I episodes. That makes way more sense to be prescribed than a sleeping pill. You’re right though he needs to be taking it as RX’d (bottle should have the dosing on it). I looked up the drug interactions and the ones listed are moderate and mostly physical although generally people with any kind of psychotic disorder I think are not supposed to use marijuana.

**Mama_Odie**:

>Just call the police for assistance to leave. If you have somewhere to go, it’s that easy. I’ve done it. He’ll put a good front on but you need to tell them you are in fear of your life because he threatened you STRANGLE you. You can’t wallow and be a scary baby. Not in front of your kids. He traumatized them enough. You can also have him removed for the threats on your life and you can change locks. Do not let another day pass in this.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e8e36p/update_my_30_f_spouse_35_m_has_been_acting_strange/) July 20, 2024

Hello, first of all thank you all for the comments, messages, etc. on my previous post. Obviously it got a bit too much to keep up with responding but I just want to say I really appreciate the help. A TL;DR at the bottom.

To give an update, I left the house the night I made the post, but went back home the following day. I wanted to be able to collect some sort of evidence I could use, because my spouse has been really good at downplaying his symptoms to any authority figure. I want to mention that I had been present at most doctor and hospital visits prior, so I know what they did recommend for him. I felt at the time that they did not give him enough help for the crisis he was obviously going through.

Anyway, continuing on, the couple days after the Sunday post, he did not really engage in much conversation with me or our children. Every time he entered the room, I set my phone to record. I did not get anything until Thursday, when he finally started talking to me again. He was questioning who I have been talking to about him and who has been trying to sabotage his life. Obviously I denied everything, because there is no one talking to me about him (aside from this Reddit post, which he didn’t know about). This started to anger him, which included him yelling at me and saying if anyone is talking to me about him, to bring him to the house so he can “take care of them himself”.

I tried to not to engage any more. This made him more upset, as he was continuing to demand answers from me. He would then say “oh I want to hit you” or “don’t make me slap you” when I was either not answering or just saying I didn’t know what he was talking about. I got this on recording. After he ended up walking away and leaving the room, I took the kids to bed, locked us in our room and tried to sleep.

The following morning, he insisted on driving me to work. I told him I wanted the car, to which he disagreed with me and said he needed it. After dropping out kids off, he started going off on me about how I am stupidity, dumb, a bitch, etc. for keeping his “inheritance” (again something he is clearly having delusions about) from him. I tried to disengage completely, keeping myself to far side of the passenger seat, which caused him to grab me by the back of my neck and pull me closer to him, where he told me to listen to him. I obviously reacted to this and was super upset, telling him to please focus on driving and not touch me again.

After he drove me to work, the last thing I said to him as he was still going off on me with the car window open, was “you desperately need help”. Once I got in, I called my boss and let her know what happened. She came in, cancelled her appointments for the day, and took me to the police station.

We made a report, although the sergeant we initially spoke to seemed to be against us making a report (he kept saying he will be homeless if I report him, like he’s the victim in this scenario). I told him my safety and the kids safety should be more important, and he brought in a different officer to make the statement with me. Once I completed that statement, they let me know to stay away from the house as they were going to arrest him, and will call once he’s out of the house.

About 5 hours later, he was arrested. Apparently he was very compliant, and with all the information I provided, they actually took him to the hospital, and he is currently on a 30 day psychiatric hold. He will be going to court at some point for uttering threats and assault, but seeing how he doesn’t have a criminal record, I’m sure it will just end up being a slap on the wrist.

So as of now, I am home, safe with the children, and we are getting our locks changed. I will also most likely get a protection order, but in an ideal world, he gets better and that’s not necessary. I guess we will see in the future.

I want to again thank every one for their comments and assistance. A lot of you made some excellent points, and although I know some of my decisions probably seemed like dumb ones, I was trying to figure out the best solution logistically for us. Any other future updates will be on my profile.

TL;DR: he was arrested yesterday and put on a psych hold. I’m okay physically but not emotionally.

>I dealt with something similar, but thankfully not with a romantic partner and we shared no assets or children. It was terrifying, and I still am affected by it daily. 

>My friend ended up being diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder (paranoid schizophrenia). He did really well on meds. Actually, so well that he stopped believing he had an issue and stopped taking the meds. His latest bout of mania legitimately scared me and I had to remove myself. 

>Your husband is starting a very long road, and a lot of mentally ill people struggle with keeping straight down that long road. I'm not saying you should remove him from your life, but I am saying you have the best chance of healing and raising unaffected adults if you do remove him. Your love for him and the family you've built cannot sustain mental illness, and love is not all you need. Sometimes it becomes way bigger than you and the kindest thing you can do is bow out.

>I'm really sorry you're all in this situation. 

**shame-the-devil**:

>Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family. The problem with your husband is that he’s already become more violent, and it will likely get worse if you let him return to the home. I have seen family members get better on medication, only to make the decision to stop medicating bc they no longer believed they were ill. Over. And over and over. I have also seen them act normally in front of others, which made it difficult to even get them help in the first place.

>One of my family members attempted to murder their caregivers. They almost succeeded.

>Another attempted to murder a person they thought was real, but who was actually a hallucination.

>You are not safe. Your children are not safe. And you are not taking this seriously enough.

**RaiseIreSetFires**:

>I'm very proud of you for taking the first step towards a new healthy life for your kids and yourself. To continue on this path you need to quit hoping for the best and start preparing for the worst. It's a long road but, you've shown the intelligence and fortitude to successfully see this through.

>That being said, I'm going to have to stress to you that he's not going to ""get better"" in 30 days.

>Get that restraining order ASAP. One reason is he will be served while in custody, instead of you having to track him down to serve him. Second reason, they look at how quickly you do these things when he goes to court for the charge. It shows you are actually going to follow through and the seriousness of your situation. Third reason is he is more likely to be charged for DV and threats. Fourth reason is it will usually make custody and separation move faster.

>This is one of those situations where shit in one hand and hope he miraculously becomes mentally healthy in 30 days in the other, which fills up quicker?

>Good luck and don't stray from your path to safety and happiness.

**OOP**:

>>Thank you, it’s definitely wishful thinking that he will get the treatment needed to go back to normal. I don’t want to think of this as the end of our relationship but at the same time I don’t know if he would want to be back with me since I got him detained.

>>Right now the only thing I’m thinking about are the kids.

**noonecaresat805**:

>Make sure as soon as the protection order is in place to let the school know that he isn’t allowed to take the kids out. Find a theraphy place for you and the kids and have them help you explain to them that it’s not safe to talk to dad at the moment. That way he won’t try to get his revenge through them. And good for you. And your right him ending up homeless is not your concern.

**OOP**:

>>They are toddlers, so a bit too young to understand. Their daycare is aware as well.

**noonecaresat805**:

>>>I work in a daycare and unless we have a restraining order on paper of the other parent shows up we have to release their child to them. There’s nothing we can do. And children are smarter than you give them credit for. Just because they can’t say everything doesn’t mean they don’t notice everything

**emmaa5382**:

>I think something to note is to keep a close eye on your kids in their early 20s and teach them the signs. It could be hereditary but with enough foreknowledge can be caught early and treated

>I too dealt with something similar. Use this time to get the divorce started. Have a plan. When the 30 day hold is up you will get immense pressure from doctors, social workers and family to take him back. Repeat variations “I do not feel safe with him on the home”, “I fear for my safety when he is around” over and over. They will try to convince me you he’s fine because they can’t release him without somewhere to go.

>Use this time to get legal advice. Use an attorney with experience with mentally ill spouses. Try and get a restraining order for you and the kids.

>I know you have a lot going on. You have to act. Thr first time my ex was hospitalized I listened and took him back. He was livid and blamed me for what happened to him. The second time he was hospitalized I was lucky to walk away with my life. Act now. You have kids to think about.

**I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband**

&#x200B;

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable.

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well.

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day.

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off.

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this?

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.

*Do not take his divorce papers to submit! Who knows what agreements or stipulations he put in there! Get a lawyer and do your own ASAP!*

&#x200B;

**aquavenatus**

*First, contact your job and tell them your situation. They might have “an immediate job opening” for you. Second, contact any nearby DV shelters and ask them for assistance with your plans. Last, file a police report so they know what’s going on; and, so your STBX cannot file a missing person’s report for you. Good luck.*

&#x200B;

**Update1 - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime.

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath.

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do.

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him.

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job.

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time.

*Forget the hidden cameras! The clauses he had written into the divorce papers are extremely troubling. God Forbid you did sign those papers, I don’t believe for a moment that your STBX would have found a way to get you pregnant, with or without your consent.*

*I know you’re pretending you didn’t find the cameras, but I would change clothes either in the bathroom or in the closet. This way he can’t threaten you with naked photos of you later on. Also, make sure all of your essential documents are on you just in case you leave quicker than you planned on leaving.*

*I hope you hear back on the new location by tomorrow. The sooner the better.*

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL to show me his favorite recipes.

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm.

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind.

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in.

*Rather than killing the power breaker unplugging the WiFi router/modem would be sufficient. Small cameras like that are wireless with possibly an sd card backup but they’re not hard wired to the internet and the internet being down is easier to pull off than the power being out since most power companies have live outage maps*

*As someone who has done this, I have to applaud you for having the courage to do it. I left my shite husband in 2017 when an opportunity opened up in my company to go from Georgia to Arizona. I secretly packed everything I owned and brought it to my office to store until my move. Then I scheduled my direct deposit to shift to my new bank account, and made all the other changes to separate us. Seven years on, it remains the very best decision I've ever made. I hope everything goes smoothly for you!*

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left.

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through.

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this.

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.

&#x200B;

**Update 4 - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him.

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex.

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess.

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.

**Update - 12 days later**

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change.

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in.

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not.

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA.

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage.

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

*Glad to her you're doing well and safely away from him. If you didn't mention it to the alleged friend group, I would send a follow-up that Alex threatened you with divorce regularly, and had a filled-out set of divorce papers as a prop. He valued your marriage so little that he used the threat of ending your marriage as a tool to micromanage your personal behavior, you have taken that lever away.*

*As far as his alleged reasons for wanting to keep close tabs on you, it's common for cheaters to accuse their partner of the same. So get an STD test, you have no idea who or what he has been doing on his business trips.*

&#x200B;

**driftwood-and-waves**

*Replying just gives more fuel for Alex. Anything OP says, even to the friends will get back to him. He will twist it and use it for his benefit.*

*Not replying will piss him off because she's not giving him any control. He can't use what she says against her or gauge where she is emotionally etc so he can plan his next step. Not replying, not reacting, not giving any more information to anyone associated with him, or anyone except her lawyer just to be safe, and having all communication go through her lawyer will make him seeth. By staying silent, and healing and doing better she is winning.*

*But I hella agree with getting tested for all the things. Go get blessed by a holy person or sage yourself and your things just to get all the ick out.*

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation.

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving.

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him.

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous…

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

*Oh yeah, demanding to be charge of all of the money, having divorce papers always filled out, setting up 3 cameras in your home, and demanding you wear a tracking device is all evidence of a nice, normal, healthy relationship. JFC. Your exSIL is such an A H. Don’t for one second take anything she said seriously. And your ex, just trying to “protect you as best he could”. BARF.*

*You should be so proud of yourself for getting away from these lunatics. The road ahead may still be bumpy at times and it’ll take more time for your nerves to settle but you did it. Seek out a therapist still because it’s certainly a lot for one person to process all on their own.*

&#x200B;

**New Update**

&#x200B;

**Divorce Proceeding Update**

&#x200B;

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’

Yeah no.

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left.

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they weren’t. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted.

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

*Congratulations, OP! You're free! Now it's time for you to heal. I wish good things to come for you and that you settle into your new life well.*

>OOP: Thank you, part of me feels like I should notice healing, but while my therapist says it's happening, I don't see it. Not yet anyway. Hopefully soon I will.

&#x200B;

**PanicConsistent9656**

*Not to sound like a broken record, but I will say... healing takes time. It's also not linear. You could be fine one day and a total mess the next, but it just goes to show how much you've been keeping in this whole time. At least now, you get to actually process your emotions instead of burying them and be made to feel like you're the bad guy for even feeling those emotions.*

*Stay strong, OP!*

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gc0lgg/aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to_confession_so_i_can/)**: October 25, 2024**

I (31F) have 3 siblings (40M, 38F, 27M) and we have a good relationship despite the age gaps between some of us. My older siblings are both married and so am I, the wedding in question is my younger brother's.

My younger brother 'Luke' is engaged to his gf of a year 'Emma' (28F), she is nice I guess but we have never really clicked and are just polite to each other. Something important is that we are all Catholic, but not really hardcore ones and some of us are even lapsed.

I do believe this whole situation started just when I met her for the first time. I look younger than Luke and it has always been a sibling joke that I am truly the baby of the family, most people that meet us assume he is older than me but nobody has had issues with it until Emma. The day I met her she kind of scoffed when I said I was happy the baby had a proper girlfriend, she has this weird thing about being the Eldest in her family and refused to believe I was older than her until I showed her my ID. She has been hot and cold with me since then, often infantilizing me or trying to have a sort of boss attitude. I just let her be and usually ignore her since I have no time to try and beg for her friendship so I am just polite and civil, always include her when planning stuff but don't really make an effort.

The family knows about it but we just shrugged it to different personalities. Then the wedding planning started. Emma decided I could not be in the wedding party since I was not married in a church, fine by me. Then she requested that immediate family submits their dress plannings so she could check it fits the wedding dress code, fine whatever. You see where this is going I hope? You'll see I have not gone to confession or have communion in more than a decade, If I go to a mass for whatever reason I am respectful and simply sit or stay standing during the rites I don't participate on. Well this is not good enough for her and she says I need to take communion during their wedding, I said no and she has not taken it well.

For the most part I avoid her as I said before but this time I wasn't gonna say yes or risk an issue. I told her for taking communion one needs to go to confession and I didn't want to. She said all immediate family is doing it and it will look bad if I don't, I told her sure fine, then I'll just go have communion in front of everybody but won't do confession. She said if this was gonna be my attitude I was uninvited from the wedding because I clearly wanted to ruin the day for her. I turned to my brother and told him 'thanks' gave him a thumbs up and went home.

My family understand my reasoning and said they respect everybody's choices but I shouldn't have said what I said. I told them I really don't want to go to the wedding anymore and I don't owe Emma explanations on my life. I only called my Grandma because she heard what happened and asked me not to disrespect the church by doing the communion without confession, I promised I wouldn't do it and she is fine with me now.

I got a text from my brother wanting to compromise so I replied by asking if the other lapsed people are being made to take confession too? He said no because it was only nuclear family members, I find it funny since all the others are clearly older than her and she just behaves like this with me and the youngsters. AITAH?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: You should alert the Priest to her behavior. He will ensure that she stops with her actions. She cannot make rules that do not exist in the church. I would send a quick email to him and let her deal with the consequences of her own actions.

>**OOP:** I actually considered it but I don't think I will since my Grandma might be doing it herself. She is lapsed herself but didn't want me to be disrespectful, but she knows the priest that will be officiating and is not really happy with all the shitshow.

*Why Emma is pushing this:*

>I honestly believe it's more her trying to have authority over me than her religious views. My oldest brother finds it ridiculous but said he would not intervene unless I ask him to which I appreciate cause despite Luke acting like a dipshit I don't want more drama.

Commenter: Just consider, that the less you do, the longer this drama will go on. Maybe getting more people involved would actually shut her behaviour down for good

>**OOP:** I don't want to give her the attention she craves. My Grandma said she will handle it with the priest and I will simply sit down. My whole family and most of the common friends know already, Luke and Emma themselves told them and shot themselves.

*Demand an apology in order to go:*

>I already told my parents I am not coming no matter what. They are clearly not pleased with how she spoke to me, but even more displeased with my brother but we agreed on not intervening more. If he wants to marry her it's his decision, he's an adult and needs no permission but what he would lose has been made clear to him.

Commenter: I would let Grandma handle it... She sounds feisty, how old is she?

>**OOP:** My Grandpa used to say she was like a firecracker lol. She's 81 and has been lapsed for like 25 years I think. She still has friends in the church community and all but they respect her decision not to participate in the rites anymore.

Commenter: Yeah, I would DEFINITELY let her handle it then. Please keep us updated. I really want to know if the wedding even happens.

>**OOP:** I am conflicted because I do love Luke very much but I dislike him right now. I know Grandma is fair and just, also now I am sure Emma doesn't even know why Grandma is lapsed and might be in for a shock.

Commenter: Can't you just go get a blessing? I'm an atheist but my parents are hardcore Catholics and my dad became a Deacon last year. They asked us (me and my siblings) to go get blessings as a compromise as none of us are religious. I still declined personally but my understanding is that going to get a blessing is common for non-confirmed and considered an act of participation. If you're just lapsed, rather than actively rejectful, then that seems like a perfect compromise and one where you can pretend to be going for communion before crossing your arms before the priest (or whichever signal said church uses).

>**OOP:** My issue is not about the blessing, it's that she singles me out and wants to have some sort of authority above me. A bunch of my family are lapsed but she has not made a big deal over it except of me.  
her stupid argument falls apart because my oldest brother is also lapsed but she doesn't seem to care or maybe she has not realized it. She has not mentioned anything to him, but is making a huge deal because I don't participate.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gcwzhl/update_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to_confession/) **1: October 26, 2024 (Next Day)**

Things have moved but I wouldn't call any of this a positive progress. 

I would like to clear something I kept seeing in the comments. I won't request a special blessing or go in the queue for communion, it isn't about the blessing or the compromise but the singling me out. I often just stay quiet or take a general family blessing if we go to weddings, etc. I have no issue with compromises I have an issue with Emma and her ridiculousness. I don't know why she has this thing with me, I do look young but not like a teen or a child obviously. She has 2 younger sisters and is very authoritative with them, I have witnesses her being very my way or the highway with younger people so she has issues for sure. 

The confrontation from the last post was on Tuesday and today we had lunch at my Grandma's. I think you should also know that my brothers have a tricky relationship, as in they are not as close with each other as they are with other siblings. My older brother 'Robert' is very no nonsense and he has never been a fan of Emma but he didn't think he should have to intervene because Luke is an adult and capable of navigating relationships. All this is gonna be relevant I promise. 

We visit Grandma a lot since she lives by herself and we truly enjoy her company. Today we were all there because she is over this drama already. After a lunch, that was more like snacking to be honest, she asked us all to clear the air. Emma continued with her rant about me being a disrespectful person and that she was asking the bare minimum from me. My Grandma asked her why she had no issue with her not taking communion and Emma said that she was her elder and for sure her reasons were more than a tantrum like it was in my case. She also repeated that she was asking this of all the siblings and I was the only one that was being difficult with her tiny request. 

This is where everything crumbled for her. I mentioned in the comments that Robert is also lapsed and he was already exhausted by this situation. He asked her why she had no issues with him not taking communion and she looked like a kid that was caught. She didn't have a proper answer. Robert then asked her if she even knew why he and Grandma became lapsed. She shook her head and looked at Luke for help, Luke on the other hand was staring angrily at Robert and I but said nothing. 

Robert explained to Emma he was the reason Grandma became lapsed. When Robert was a teen he came out as gay and was so worried about our Grandparents reaction since they were very active in the Catholic church. Grandma felt awful about it and even worse when she went and spoke about this with the then Priest of her Church, that Priest was super old school and told her that Robert was committing sins, he was going to hell, he needed to find his way, the whole nine yards. Grandma didn't take that so well and simply stopped going to Church and started spending that time with her grandchildren. Over the years she started getting into the whole community again but she decided she was done taking the sacraments, she respects parts of the church but can't fully reconcile with it.

Emma was a bit confused since Robert is married to a woman and he explained he is bisexual and ended up with a woman just as he could have ended with a man. He also commented they are not married in the church but that didn't matter to her like it mattered when it came to me. He asked her directly what was her problem with me.

Long story short, she said I was rude since the beginning and kept treating Luke wrong. Oh and I also was very snarky about looking younger than her. Crickets. She is a beautiful successful woman so I still don't understand her obsession but it seems like she wants people to see I respect her and what she says. I just started laughing, she started crying and saying I turned my Grandma against her. My Grandma told her to stop blaming people for her being a negative person and she was always going to side with me over her. Luke got upset at that and asked her why she was not supporting him and she simply said she doesn't support him being a lap dog for a crazy woman. 

More was said, nothing got truly resolved. I was kind of invited again but declined going, Grandma is undecided if she even wants to go at all. My older siblings told Luke they will go to the ceremony if he seeks couples therapy or at least therapy. My parents are having headaches and now dislike Emma so much they can't hide it. Oh! And yes Grandma spoke with the Priest and he wants them to do extra premarital counseling or he won't officiate.

I hope they don't get married but he is old enough to derail his life if he wants. I thank you for letting me vent and my Grandma loved the Pope joke!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gebhae/update_2_to_aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to/) **2: October 28, 2024 (2 days later, 3 from OG post)**

My brother has gone too far and I decided to be done with him. He made our Grandma cry and I think permanently damaged a lot of his relationships. I want to mention some of my cousins and other family members thought I was just stubborn and creating drama but now there is no longer my side or Emma's side. Maybe he always felt this way but the issue he has with Robert is absolutely ridiculous.

He was so upset with what Grandma said about him being Emma's lap dog that he called her to speak about it. I was obviously not present for the conversation but Grandma told me what happened and Luke confirmed it.

He told her that it was unfair of me to ask Robert for help since he was her favorite grandchild and would get her to side with me no matter how wrong I was. He also told her that many of the cousins believe this and that it was so obvious since she even left her religion for him, he claimed the other LGBTQ+ members of the family (most were not even born when Robert came out by the way) doubted if she would do it for them.

So Grandma explained to Luke and then call every single one of her grandchildren to ask them how they felt and explain to each a part we didn't know. She said that when Robert came out and she spoke with the old Priest he hinted about knowing of places to set Robert 'straight'. Grandma had heard horror stories from this places and so had Robert and they both spoke with my parents together about that not being an option at all. My parents never intended to send Robert there and are very casual Catholics, but Grandma wanted to cover the basis just in case. I was told Grandma sounded like she had being crying on the phone and after the first couple of calls, which went from oldest to youngest the group chat started to blow. Robert is livid, our LGBTQ+ cousins are livid and say Luke lied, even the cousins that were telling me to stop being a stubborn head are livid.

By the time I was up for my call I was already on the way to Grandma's. Two of my cousins were already there and the youngest one, Sara (16F), was ready to literally fight Luke. For a bit of levity Sara is about 35 cm smaller than Luke and the image of her swinging at him made me laugh a bit, she asked if I was making fun of her and I just explained the whole mental image of her trying to hit him and she admitted it was kind of funny. What I didn't tell her is I would love to slap some sense into Luke.

My Grandma has been through so much in her life and this is not what we want for her. She looks puffy faced and kept asking everybody if they truly felt unloved by her, saying she would do everything for any of us. Explaining how Robert was the oldest grandchild but that didn't mean she loved the rest any less. She is a strong woman, but I think something inside her broke a little with the thought she hurt her grandchildren. It was a shitshow, a big one and I was just so done with Luke.

My parents have been passive towards the situation so far because I asked them to, but after they heard what happened they told him they need time away from him. Robert is simply disgusted and decided to not speak with him anymore, which he communicated through the cousin group chat with Luke's response being that this is why Emma's help on reining all us would be so beneficial if we just let her. He also added how Robert never cared for him or anybody really and he just tried to be the center of attention all the time. He cited his coming out, his announcement he was gonna marry a woman, the birth of his child, it was ridiculous. He came out when Luke was a toddler and for many years only our parents and grandparents knew. He announced he was gonna marry his now wife through a text but didn't interfere or took from anybody. His child was born 4 months before Luke's graduation and apparently that was a big issue for Luke that he never commented.

Maybe I am biased, maybe I am selfish like Emma claims, but I call bullshit on his tantrum. Every single one of the cousins has been helped, babysat, tutored, gotten out of trouble, you name it by Robert. He isn't perfect but he isn't the conniving ass Luke is claiming. Maybe Luke has always felt inadequate and we didn't notice, maybe it was his last ditch effort, maybe Emma has manipulated him so far that he can't come back. It doesn't matter anymore.

If he does marry Emma I wish him the best, if he doesn't I hope he goes to therapy. Regardless of what he decides he burned so many bridges and hurt so many people, I don't see this resolving any time soon. For now I will focus on my Grandma and making her feel better. I feel extremely guilty because it was Emma's situation with me that opened this can of worms, I know I shouldn't but it's hard not to.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wow it sounds like it is self projection from Luke he is the conniving asshole he is saying Robert is.

>**OOP:** Robert is the type of older cousin Sara would call if she is drunk at a party and needs a safe ride. He also did it for Luke which is why I don't get his deal.

Commenter: Irrational behavior is called that because it can't be rationalized. Luke is exhibiting very irrational behavior which is why you'll never understand it. The best you can hope for is that he gets some serious therapy and pulls his head out of his ass sooner rather than later!

>**OOP:** If he asked for help and apologized sincerely, I would be there in 2 seconds. He knew what he was doing when he spoke with out Grandma, he knew it would cause her pain, he knew he would hurt Robert too.  
Robert might not be crying but he feels bad about the situation, he has always looked out for everybody and even has pics of him holding every single one of us as babies all over one of his walls. I always knew there were not the closest of brothers but this is too much.

Commenter: This is not your doing. Understand this is all Emma’s fault. She knows it too. I’d bet money she is realizing how much her need to feel superior to you is costing. \[...\]

>**OOP:** Logically, I know this is on Emma and Luke. But seeing my Grandma so sad and trying to convince everybody she loves us makes me feel bad. I know she will bounce back though!

Commenter: It may be that her purpose is to isolate him.

Please tell your grandmother from another old lady not to doubt herself because Luke has decided to live in crazy town

>**OOP:** I don't know anymore. He is still very active with our maternal family so far, I am unsure how they will react when or if they hear what happened because both families have a great relationship. He still has a strong support system when it comes to friends, some even dislike or disapprove of Emma and are vocal about it.  
I am seriously on the wave that this was low key less about me and more a poke to Robert.  
And thanks, she really needs a lot of love.

Commenter: NTA Your little brother and his fiancée sound insane, as he thinks y'all are obligated to let some unhinged random woman to ""rein"" you all in because he likes fucking her? With his tactics with your grandma, I think you need to stop saying this is all on Emma. 

Look back at her having an issue with you because of how you mistreat Luke. Which from your account doesn't seem happens. It sounds like your brother has created a narrative of the situation that is likely not recognizable as truth by anyone else. Maybe he resents being the kid and no one listening to him and figures he can get his way by acting victim. Who knows? 

>**OOP:** You hit a point I have been trying to avoid. Maybe he has been like this all the time and Emma is just putting a magnifier on it.  
I must say he was the center of attention when it was about him: graduations, birthdays, presentations, engagement party. He got celebrated on his achievements just as loud as everybody else. Grandma tried to always be there, so did our parents.  
He was always invited to stuff, always asked for his opinion on group decisions, he has always been loved.

Commenter: I posted this on the other post, but if she is such a good Catholic she should know you can’t take communion anyway, since you weren’t married in the church. I wouldn’t break the rules for this psycho. Hope your brother gets away from her before she hurts anymore people.

>**OOP:** Oh that is so out of the question now, I wouldn't go to that wedding even if the Pope himself asked me to. I am going no contact with Luke and so are most of my relatives due to his conversation with Grandma.",LucyAriaRose,2024-11-04,3432,BestofRedditorUpdates
My mom admitted my sister is perfect and I am not,"My whole life my mom has favored my older sister. 

All my parents’ friends know that my sister is a lawyer. I will be asked if I’m the lawyer and when I say no, I’m the teacher, you can hear crickets. It’s like they didn’t even know I existed and don’t know what to say. 

Another example: I went back to school to get my second credential for special education in early childhood. My mom kept telling me that dad is not good and to quit to help her help him. But my sister decided to run for office as a District Attorney right before my dad died. My mom decides to help my sister run for office because “it was a life long dream of hers (sister’s dream). I turned in my last assignment 4 week early so I could help more with my dad. (BTW, I have young children and worked a teaching job with a teaching partner for 50% contract. I never slept during that time.)

Today, my mom went to a music thing at my son’s school with me. I saw a former family of mine and student. I talked for a minute or two, then walked away to join my mom and daughter to get my son from his classroom. I told her they were a former family. She starts talking rude to me and said,
 “You didn’t introduce me to them.”
 I said, “I didn’t think about.” 
Mom said: “you never do.”
Me: “I’m sorry I’m not perfect like my sister.”
Mom: “No, you’re not and you never will be.”
Me: “I know and I have accepted it.” And walk away into the building to get my son. I decided I’m not getting in the same car as her. So, I called my husband to pick us up now. I didn’t tell my mom we were leaving. 
*** there are two entrances/exits to the building and my mom didn’t know about it. 

I just wanted to let out. And the sad part is I haven’t shed a tear. I wish my dad was still here. 

Edit: A few people asked about my relationship with my sister. My sister and I barely have a relationship. Last year after her wedding, she told me she keeps her distance from me because of the way I treat our mom. She has no idea how I treat our mom because we only see each other for Easter and Christmas and once a year text for our birthdays. So, she is going off of what our mom says. 

Also, I am 42 and my sister is 44. Her and her husband do not want to have kids. So, my children will be the only grandchildren for my parents. 

Edit: my mom is 70.

UPDATE: I have gone NC. She texted me the next morning saying sorry, no one is perfect including her and my sister. She is stressed because she is moving and other things. She loves me. Will I forgive her? I didn’t respond. 

The next day she text saying her escrow closed and if she could come on Saturday to move her stuff out of my house to take to her house. (Yes, I let her move a room full of boxes in a spare room so she didn’t rent a storage shed.) I didn’t respond. My husband surprised me when he took the day off and text her that he will help her move the boxes to her house while I was at work and the kids were at school. I love my husband so much! 

Today, I found out that my son and mom were texting an hour after the incident. My son said she should have said what she said. (I didn’t tell him what was said just no one should say what she said.) She texted him back saying that she feels unappreciated for everything she does but for him she will apologize. So, her apology was fake. 

Edit: her number has been blocked on my son’s phone.",Dntkillthemessager1,2024-05-16,3385,TrueOffMyChest

Fraud or Incompetence - There goes my rent,"I recently ordered some eggs and ground beef for a gathering. The shopper made some substitutions - which were NOT the approved replacements.

Of particular concern was replacing 20lbs of ground beef @ $70 with 19 CASES of Prime Ground Ribeye Patties @ $80ea for a nice total of $1541!! I’m surprised the charge went through. No contact about substitutions was made.

I was delivered - a case of eggs and 20lbs of ground beef. I would add a photo, but apparently only one is allowed.

I contacted Instacart, it’s been a week. I’ve gotten two emails saying it will be addressed within 24 hours. And so far crickets. As far as I can tell there’s no customer service phone number to call.

Did the store clerk scan an incorrect bar code?
Does the shopper not verify the items against the receipt? 

What do you think? Fraud or incompetence?
Do I file police report?

Shitty Grandma,"So my mother asked me if my 11 year old daughter would like to go to the movies with her. When I asked my daughter she seemed very reluctant. I asked her why and she said somethings her grandmother talks about makes her uncomfortable. I said do you want me to tell her no that you are busy or do you want me to tell her how you are uncomfortable & why. She chose the truth and to tackle the issue. So I text my mom saying she is reluctant to go because somethings you talked about the last time she saw you made her feel uncomfortable. Examples: school counselors turning kids gay, christians being persecuted & how you they had to man the church doors at the church holiday celebration to make sure the guy with tourettes would not come in and possibly swear infront of children. (What happened to everyone being welcome & teaching kids empathy or inclusivity?)

My friends and I can not stop playing a board game. It ruined our lives.,"I can barely remember what life was like before we found the game that June night. We were 6 high school kids bored out of our minds, trying our best to fill the void. Most of us had part-time summer jobs but we were hesitant to spend money on anything. We all hoped to save for college.  



After what felt like hours going back and forth on deciding what to do for the day we took a walk around our suburban neighborhood. 



It was the end of a yard sale day and most people were packing up and heading inside, a few people still remained outside eager to sell. We didn't really have the intention to buy anything but I still combed through the last pieces of used crap people set out. I always think I'm going to find some kind of amazing treasure but always end up questioning my purchases hours later. 



I found myself digging through a shoebox full of old board games. I thought I might be able to find a new game for all of us to play. I also figured since it was the end of the day I might get it for super cheap. At first, I only saw games that looked in too bad of shape to even buy. That or it was a game I knew my friends wouldn't want to play. I've always been a board game fan, but not so much my friends. I had to beg them for months to play DnD with me and they were only willing to play it for my birthday. I'm always trying to find new games that might interest them. 



I was ready to give up, but then I saw a game at the bottom that I'd never heard of. *‘Tasks with friends’* with the tagline *‘The game you and your friends will never want to put down!’* The box looked colorful and pretty worn out, but not so bad that we couldn't play with it. It just looked well-loved. I tried to open it up, but the sides were taped down. I mean, It makes sense. You don't want all the pieces to come flying out after all. 



I didn't see a price tag or sign for the price so I found the owner and asked her. 



“Excuse me, how much are you charging for the game?” I said eagerly to the woman while admiring the bright-colored box that lacked any company branding or trademarking. 



“Oh, that old thing? I don't know, do you have a dollar on you?” The woman said as she put the yard sale leftovers into one big box. 



As she told me the price I perked up and started to dig through my purse. She either got annoyed with me taking too long or just wanted to be nice and told me ""to just take it."" She immediately started to back up her box again.



“So, uh…Is the game any fun?” I said to her awkwardly. 



“I actually never played it. My friend Jen gave it to me a few years back because her kids got obsessed over it or something so she just wanted to get rid of it. She thought my family would enjoy it, but we just never got around to playing it.” She said with her back facing me. I kindly Thanked her and called for my friends to come over to see what I got. 

As I called for them, I could see their curiosity over what I found. That excitement was quickly lost when they saw I had a board game in my hands. They rolled their eyes knowing that I would try and get them to play it with me. 



“Kate, you know we don't do the *board game thing,*” Aaron said to me annoyed.



“Come on guys! You've all been going on and on all day about how bored you are. At least try. This game looks really fun. I actually haven't played this one before so we can all learn together!” I said as I saw their faces start to grow curious again.



James came up to me and gestured at the box in my hand. I gave it over to him, hoping that he would be convinced to play after looking at it. I knew if he was down to play everyone else would be too. 



As he held the box, I could see the expression on his face change from doubt to excitement. 



“Damn, this game looks like fun! Let's go play.” He said with a giddy tone I'd never heard him use. 



He started to jog in the direction of his house with me close behind and the rest of our friends slowly walking behind me, looking confused as to why James was so excited to play a board game when he was normally the person most against them. 



We all made It back to James’ house. We walked in and were greeted by his mom confused as to what made her emotionless son so excited. As we stood in the entryway not sure what to say, we heard him calling us from the basement.



We ran down the steps to see the game fully set up on the floor and ready to play. He was sitting on a pillow reading the instructions with intense concentration. 



“James, are we actually playing this game?” Brie whined 



“Yes, we are. I promise If you just sit down and start to play you will have fun. I had a chance to learn the rules while you guys got here. James insisted as he shuffled a pile of cards one last time. 



After a few minutes of back and forth, everyone was sitting down and ready to play. James explained the rules of the game directly from the intrusion manual:



“Each player starts with their token at the start of the board. Players will take turns drawing a card from the top of the deck. Each card will have a task. If that task is completed, you may move the number of spaces that are specified on the card. Once you see the card, It will say ‘secret’ or ‘public’ at the top. If it's a ‘secret’ card do not read it out loud. This task must be completed without anyone noticing or questioning the action on the card. For example: hold someone's hand, sing a song, insult someone, etc. Just complete the task without anyone calling you out. If a player does something you believe to be a ‘secret’ task, say out loud ‘deceiver’ if the player was caught, they will show their card and fail their task. Do not move any pieces. If the person who calls out ‘deceiver’ wrongly accuses the player, then they must move back one space. The accused player will keep that card and continue to try and complete the task. Once you have successfully completed a ‘secret’ task, you may announce ‘task complete’ and move your token forward as many spaces as specified on your task card. If you pull a ‘public’ card, you must read it out loud. These cards will include things like saying the alphabet backwards, don’t say ‘um’ or ‘uh’ until your next turn, singing a karaoke song, playing dead for one minute, etc. Some cards have time limits and specific instructions. Every card will clearly state the task. The player who gets their token to the end of the board wins. The game will start with the player who lied last drawing a card. Take turns drawing one card at a time with the person to your right going next. Have fun!”

 

James folded the paper instructions up and sat them by his side. Asking if anyone had questions. No one said anything. It seemed like they all understood the game fine. Or maybe they just didn't care yet. 



“Alright, let's get the game started.” James proclaimed but was met with blank stares. “Come on guys, I just read the rules, you should know how the game starts, we have to start with who lied last.” Everyone remained silent. No one wanted to say their last lie.



“This is so dumb. I guess I’ll go. I told my mom that Henry wasn't hanging out with us when I left the house. There. I'll go first.” Brie blurted out as she leaned forward to grab a card. As she looked at it she rolled her eyes. “This is so dumb. Why are we playing this game?” 



“Come on Brie, It can't be that bad. Can you read it out loud?” Henry said sensing that the card was embarrassing.



“Ugh, public card: *pretend to be a cow for 3 minutes*.” She threw the card down and looked at Henry who was to her right. Expecting her turn to just be over and not wanting to even try. The rest of the group started to laugh and encourage her. Chanting her name and begging her to do it. After about a minute, she gave in and got down on her hands and knees. When she first started, she was annoyed. Staring daggers at Henry. As her time ran down, I could see in her face her feelings towards the game change. When the timer went off, she didn't stop for a few seconds. She kept going because she was laughing so hard. 



“That was so fun! Someone move my token up one space. Henry, it's your turn now!” Brie said with a giggle and a newfound excitement. Henry looked at her in disbelief. He was so used to her cold exterior but liked that this game made it melt away. 





Henry picked up his card. He motioned zipping his lips shut and shook his head. Me, Brie, and James all squealed in excitement with the rest of the group looking lost. Not understanding what they missed that got us so excited. 



Since Henry had a secret card, It was AJ’s turn. She was chuckling along but clearly just doing it because she didn't want to look dumb for asking us what was so funny. She pulled her card and read it out loud. 



“Um, It's a public card.” She said with a dry tone trying to gauge the room and observe everyone else as they celebrated her public card. “It says I have to do jumping jacks until my next turn.” As she stood up everyone in the room cheered her on except for Aaron. As she got to her feet she paused and looked over at Aaron. I can imagine he felt like the only sane person in the room and wasn't sure what was going on. After a second of hesitation, she started her jumping jacks. Aaron looked around at us eyeing him down desperately waiting for him to read his card. 



By the time he finally picked up his card, AJ had started to laugh while doing her jumping jacks.



“Sorry, It's a *secret card.*” Aaron said nervously as everyone wiggled with happiness.



“Well, Looks like It's my turn-” I said as I leaned forward but was cut off by Henry quickly standing to his feet and lunging towards AJ. Tackling her to the ground interrupting her jumping jacks and making a loud thump as they hit the ground. 



“Henry, what the hell are you doing? What's wrong with you?” Aaron yelled in a serious tone that turned into him trying *not* to laugh by the end of the sentence. 



“I'm calling a deceiver on that tackle Henry.” Brie stated with a laugh 



“Okay, okay you got me.” Henry said while still laying on AJ from his tackle. They both smiled over the event even though it clearly hurt when they hit the floor. “But you have to admit, that one was tricky. “ 



I tried to start my turn again but was interrupted by Aaron.



“Ha! Task completed. I yelled at Henry and didn't get caught. I get to move 2 spaces.” He said as he smugly moved his token 2 spaces on the game board.



We kept playing the game for hours. We finished the first game and everyone wanted to play again. And again. And again. I looked around at them in disbelief. It felt impossible that all my friends were enjoying a board game. It was a dream come true. After years of begging. *Finally.* Normally at hangouts like this by 10 pm Brie and Henry would wander off to make out in some closet, AJ goes home to sleep, and Aaron, James, and I are left to awkwardly try and find something to do with just the three of us. It got to be 2:00 am and we were either exhausted or our parents calling us telling us to come home or we would be in serious trouble. 



We all went back to our houses but all had a hard time going to sleep. We stayed up until 5 am for some of us, just talking about the game over text. Strategies, when we could play again, funny things that happened that night. We couldn’t get enough. 



The games we played started out pretty simple. No tasks got too wild and while we really loved to play, it wasn’t like it was taking over our whole lives. Not *yet* at least. 

  


Because we played the game at James’ house the first time, we ended up just keeping it there. Even though the game was technically mine, we always hung out at his place so it just made sense. It was around 10 am the next day when our group chat started to blow up with everyone asking when we could get together that day. Now, because it was summertime and we were all teenagers, we either had work in the mornings or most of us slept until noon. But not me. I was always up early waiting for my friends to get up so I had something to do. Or trying to make some money as a dog walker. That being said, I was shocked when I saw that everyone was up and everyone claimed to not have work. James didn’t have a job at that point so of course he was free but everyone else was too. That did not happen often. 



We all met up at James' place at around 11 am that same day. Everyone eager to play. We must've played 10 games that day. The games consisted of us doing accents, being banned from saying certain words, backflips, and so on. Nothing too weird. We realized after a few games that we never got a repeating card. Not one time. This was strange because there were probably 200 cards in the deck, but even with us playing a dozen games, every card was new. 



I knew I had a couple of dogs to walk that evening but texted the owners to cancel. No way was I going to leave while all my friends were enjoying a board game this much. I knew AJ said something about her having a shift at 4 pm, but when the time got close she went to the other side of the room and called out of work. She didn't even mention it to us or talk about it. She just stood up, walked to the corner, talked to her manager, and came back. No one thought anything of it. 



After a few minutes, she loudly proclaimed “Task completed!” moving her token up 3 spaces. We looked around confused at what task she had and the card said *‘Call out sick to work.’* We were surprised by this card, to say the least. It was the first time a card had to do with something outside of the players. 



Everyone else in the group canceled any plans they had for the rest of the day. Although AJ was the only person who completed a task for it. 



It was around 11 pm which made it a full 12 hours of the game. Brie pointed out that we forgot to eat any food all day. After thinking about it, I realized that I hardly drank any water, and went to the bathroom like one time all day. 



Things started to get out of hand that night. AJ pulled a card that said to go into a closet with the player to her left and kiss them for 5 minutes. Of course, that player was Henry.  Brie was not happy but she knew how serious everyone was about the game. She told him she wasn't okay with it but he insisted that it was just a game and it wouldn't mean anything. It was worth 4 points for both people who would go into the closet. 



AJ and Henry stood up and went to find a suitable space, all while Brie freaked out and said she would end things with Henry if he went through with it. It was never completely clear what Henry and Brie *were*. They don't like to use *‘boyfriend’* and *‘girlfriend’* but everyone knew they were a thing. 



Aaron tried to call it off. Saying this wouldn't be worth it and to just stop, but it was like they didn't even hesitate. Brie sat on the carpet and started to cry as the timer on her phone counted down an agonizing 5 minutes. 



I thought I would either hear kissing or nothing at all but instead, I heard talking. It started as soft whispers, then crying and yelling. They stayed in for about 2 minutes then came tumbling out. 



“That's it Henry I can't believe you would do that for a game! We are over.” Brie said with a red wet face. 



Henry came and silently sat down with AJ. AJ was now beet red as well. Despite three of my friends just going through something I couldn't wrap my head around, they all looked at James calmly and nodded for him to pull his card. No one had moved any tokens forward so it was clear they failed their task of kissing in the closet. 



James hesitantly leaned in for a card and read it to himself as we were bombarded by Brie, AJ, and Henry all saying, 



“Task completed!” and then shot confused faces at each other. They all threw down their cards and moved their tokens forward. Brie’s card said ‘break up with Henry’ Henry's card said ‘Make AJ cry’ and AJ’s card said ‘Tell Henry you love him’ All those cards were worth way more than the stupid kissing card, so the kissing task was ignored and they all individually completed their our tasks without ever communicating it with each other. They all saw opportunities to complete a task worth more points and they took it. After this moment, It was like nothing even happened. The girls stopped crying and started laughing and saying how impressive the completion of the tasks were. 



“Wait guys, something is wrong here. Do you not see it?” Aaron said with concern trying to take a break from the game. 



“Oh, stop. You are just jealous you didn't get to move 6 spaces.” Brie said with arrogance



“No, I'm not talking about that. Does no one find It weird that the cards are using our names now? Not only that, but the cards are somehow interacting with other cards to almost try and make bad things happen?” James blurted. 



As he said that, It was like we all froze in our spots. All looking at each other, realizing how hungry and tired we were. Looking around at the room seeing how big of a mess we made. Brie grabbing Henry’s hand with a look of sadness and coming to grips with how they hurt each other for a game. 



I looked down at my arm and was reminded of the crud things I had drawn on my arm with Sharpies in order to move one space in an earlier game. I saw Aaron’s jeans that were now cut into shorts with some kid's scissors. I looked at James’ legs and saw his one shaved leg lying crossed over the untouched hairy one. I looked at AJ and saw she had a huge purple bruise on her arm. At that moment I remembered feeling like an addict trying to get off drugs. I knew this game was hurting us. I wanted to stop but felt like I couldn't. I could see the same feeling in all my friends' eyes too. The urge to say ‘one more game’ just *one* more time. Just to feel the high of this dumb game again. 



“I…I…think we need to take a break from this game, guys. It's getting kinda weird and out of hand.” I murmured with the strength that I somehow mustered up. 



It was like telling an alcoholic you were taking away their beer. They all looked horrified at the idea of not playing the game for even a moment. Just then, James’ mom came downstairs and was horrified at what she was looking at. 6 disheveled teenagers all sitting in a circle looking like they had all just been through a war. Not only that, but her whole basement was a mess.  



“James, what the hell happened to your leg? Are you all playing that dumb game again? I can't believe this. Everyone out of my house. James, you are grounded!” His mom shouted with rage in her voice. 



We all ran out of his house not saying a word to each other. Just trying to get home and get some food. 



As I sat in my kitchen with my long-sleeved sweatshirt covering my now inked-up arm, I tried to eat a sandwich I made myself. I was starving. I could feel and hear my stomach growling, but my need to play the game was so much stronger. So strong I didn't even want to eat. 



I sat at my dining room table staring at that sandwich for what felt like an eternity. Telling myself that I needed to eat and I'd feel better if I did, but somehow the thought of the game was taking up all my energy. 



I was holding back the urge to text my friends. It took every ounce of self-control I had left. 



I felt my phone buzz in my pocket and I involuntarily grabbed my phone so fast it was in my hand before I could even think about it. 



It was James in our group chat.



“Hey guys, so do you think that was a long enough break? I think I can find where my mom put the game and bring it to that old treehouse back behind Mr. Baker's house.” 



I couldn't hold back anymore. I had to play again. Before I knew it I was sneaking out of my house trying to remember where the old treehouse was. 



As I ran through the neighborhood my phone lit up with texts from my friends saying they were on their way. 



After running around for a while, I found the tree house. I couldn't believe I had such a hard time finding it considering how much time a few of us used to spend in it during middle school. 



I could hear all their voices sounding annoyed as I was the last one to get there. I climbed up the old wooden ladder to find all my friends sitting in a perfect circle, barely able to see the board or each other.



It was around this time something strange happened within the game. It wasn't about winning the game necessarily, it was about playing as many games as possible and completing as many tasks as we could. If *anyone* won a game or finished a task, everyone felt a high, not just the winner. Because of this, players stopped calling each other out for trying to complete secret tasks, so people stopped being so secretive to complete secret tasks. They still kept them a secret because it was a rule of the game, just no one called them out. This made us all more ruthless.   



I sat down on the hardwood in between Brie and James. Our next game began. 



AJ drew a card first and it was a secret card. She didn't seem giddy. She looked flush and scared. In fact, It felt like the mood had shifted with everyone. We weren't laughing our butts off anymore. We were terrified to stop playing. It was something in our guts that made us have to play. Like a virus growing in us, desperately trying to get out. 



Next, Aaron drew a card and read it out loud. “Hold your breath for 5 minutes'  he whispered with confusion. “How am I supposed to do that?” He said, trying to not get worried. 



It's not that the card was all that bad. It's that he knew he would stop at nothing to make it happen. He told us to keep playing the game while he did it and got a timer up on his phone. He took a few deep breaths then held his nose shut and became extremely focused. Not making eye contact with anyone. 



Next, it was James’ turn. He had a secret card and didn't show much emotion towards it. 



Next Brie nervously took a card and yet again, It was a secret card. In fact, we all drew a secret card until it was Aaron's turn again. It had been about 45 seconds and he was really focusing and we didn't want to make him draw a card while trying to finish his task.



As we sat and watched our friend become more and more red from holding his breath, we found ourselves in complete silence. Other than the wind weaving its way through the trees outside and the soft sound of crickets in the distance, we all just stared at each other. Terrified of what was on those secret cards. I knew I had to use every little bit of self-control I had left in my body to not try and complete the task on my card. I was betting that's why everyone was being so quiet. They all had tasks that they didn't want to do but felt the uncontrollable urge to do it. 



My card said that I needed to remove one of James’ fingers by any means necessary. It was worth 10 points. I couldn't believe I wanted to complete it so badly, but I was frozen figuring out how to do it.



As I stared at him, I noticed he was looking over at Brie. I figured that his card had something to do with her. It seemed like everyone was fixated on someone else. 



I glanced down at the timer Aaron had and I was amazed to see he had been holding his breath for almost two minutes. Just as I was about to comment on it, chaos broke loose. Everyone jumping on to someone else. Making it one big pile of people viciously grabbing each other. 



I didn't read their cards myself, but it was clear by their actions what their tasks were.



Of course, as you know, I was going for James’ fingers, but James’ was ripping at Brie's ear, Brie was pulling Henry’s hair out, Henry was tearing at AJ’s neck, and AJ was trying to open my mouth to get my tongue. For a solid 30 seconds, we were all attaching each other when Aaron passed out from holding his breath. This seemed to snap us out of our trance for a bit. 



We ran over to our friend and checked his pulse. After we realized he was still breathing we got lost in the game again and all jumped on each other to keep brutalizing one another. Just as I got my teeth around James’ pinky finger, we saw a bright flashlight coming through the cracks in the tree house and froze. A police officer popped his head through the bottom entrance to the tree house and looked at us in horror. He saw Aaron out cold in the corner alone with the rest of us in a pile of blood and ripped-out hair. The officer grabbed us one by one and practically threw us to the ground where another officer put us each in handcuffs. 



We had hours and hours of questioning that night but we were all released by sunrise. No one was badly injured. Just a lot of cuts, bruises, and a few patches of hair missing. Even Aaron was okay. Honestly, Aaron made it out in the best shape. 



We all got grounded for the rest of the summer. All the parents agreed that we needed to stop spending time together because they insisted on us having some beef between us all. 



None of us mentioned the board game was at the treehouse that night because we didn't want them to take it away from us. We knew we *had* to play it again. However, they caught on to it and banned us from ever playing it again. 



We spent the next 3 weeks of summer miserable. Each one of us tried to fill the hunger to play the game by playing other board games or attempting to remake it but it wasn't the same. 



It was the night before school started and I got a message from James through Skype. Our parents banned us from talking to each other but it seemed my parents and James’ parents forgot about Skype. He told me I had to come over right now. I managed to hop out my window and ran for James’ house. 



I got to his house in what felt like record time and jumped down the fire escape to the basement. 

There I saw the rest of my friends all sitting by the fireplace weeping. 



As I got closer I saw they were covered in ash. I saw tiny little bits of what was left of the game lying out on the ground. 



“She burned it…My mom burned it.” James said in between tears. 



Everyone was desperately trying to find any pieces that were left of our precious game. Some of them rubbed the ashes of the game on their faces and arms to try and feel something again. As I watched them I saw something in the corner of my eye. I looked over to our normal hang-out area and saw it. I saw the board game sitting out. Not just the box, but the whole game was out and ready to play. 



“Umm…are you sure that your mom burnt it, James?” I said as my eyes got glazed over looking at the beautiful board game sitting out for us to enjoy. 



“Yes, I'm sure. She did it right in front of me so I'd stop looking for it.” Just as James finished his sentence he looked at me and then at my eyeline. He saw the game.



The next week of our lives was a whirlwind. After James’ mom burned the game and it reappeared, we all ran away with the game. We stole a car from AJ’s mom after we got a task card for it and left town. We would play the game in the car, in random fast-food restaurants, and sometimes in parks. It's all we did all day. We would fall asleep playing the game and only manage to eat maybe a bag of chips or something small during the day. We kept moving because we didn't want to be found. 



In that week we all managed to lose our jobs and all missed the first week of our senior year of high school. All because we were addicted to a board game. 



I still remember the last game we ever played. It was a late Sunday night, we were actually in our town sitting in an old barn near the tree house we sat in before. All because the board game told us to. Up to that point, we were hanging out far away from home. We didn't want to be so close. We knew we could be found easily by our families and the authorities if we were too close but we had no choice. We were slaves to the game. 



At this point, we were in bad shape. With every new game started we broke down a little bit more. We surrounded the board with tired eyes and growling stomachs. Missing teeth and bruised bodies. Concussed heads and broken toes.



“Please, we have to stop. I can't do it anymore. I want to go home.” Brie said as we were about to start our next game. 



“I can't imagine not playing this game. It's all I ever want to do. I think I might die if I couldn't play it. I know the game hurts us, but it would hurt so much more if we stopped playing it.” Henry said with a gravelly voice. 



“Guys, why are we talking? We have to play again.” Aaron said while trying not to cough. 



“I know we have to. I've never hated something and loved something so much in my whole life.” Brie remarked. 



We started the game with shaky hands. Moving slowly and holding our breath whenever someone looked at their card. AJ went first. She reached down and picked a card. Cringing to herself after reading it in her head.



Next was Brie. She rolled her eyes and she read off the words. 



“Public card: Water board the player to your right for 5 minutes. Both players move 8 spaces.” Brie timidly said as she glanced at James sitting next to her. 



I can't say we really knew how to waterboard someone, but we laid him on his back with his legs elevated and dripped water over him. We let him take a card for his turn before Brie started the waterboarding so we didn't have to wait for 5 minutes for them to be done. His card was a secret card. 



We continued the game with the awful background sounds of gagging and choking.



Next, it was Aaron's turn. He read his card and winced. He closed his eyes tight and opened them again. As if he was hoping he was in a dream. As he opened his eyes he slowly looked at all of us. Making eye contact with each one of us. Just then, James was done being waterboarded and he and Brie came to join us. I was so glad they were done. Not just because I was sick of the sounds, but because it meant they got to move 8 spaces.



Aaron stood to his feet slowly. I prepared myself because I figured he was about to hurt us. In an instant, he ran out of the barn and into our stolen car. We all looked around confused as to where we went but kept playing the game as he drove off.



Next, it was my turn. *“Public card: jump off the roof of the barn. 9 points.” I said out loud nervously.* 



Henry and AJ jumped up and started to walk outside. Not even questioning if I would do it or not. They weren't wrong in the assumption. Before I could even think I was on my feet trying to find a way up to the roof. I found my way to the top of the 10-foot-tall building. I took a deep breath and leaped off and was met with a hard thump as I hit the ground. I felt a gut-wrenching pain in my right ankle as I landed. I knew I broke it. I had no doubt in my mind. I was thrashing in pain grabbing my ankle as my friends dragged me back into the barn. We knew we had to keep playing. 



Next, Henry took a card. He picked it from the pile with his eyes closed and brought it to his face while peaking just enough to see the words on the card, then closed his eyes again trying to pretend he never read the words in the first place.



Next AJ took a card. Even though it was a secret card, I knew it was about me. She glanced down at my ankle right after her eyes left the card. Just as James was reaching for his card, we saw Aaron walk back into the barn. 



We all sat in shock as his silhouette became clear and vivid in the doorway. Blood trickled down his arms and hands, dripping on the dirt as we all stared at each other. His eyes were blank at first but then turned to pain. We watched him as he walked from the doorway to the game board, blood dripping on the game as he moved his token 30 spaces. 



“Aaron…what have you done? 30 spaces?” AJ muttered in fear. 



“James, I…I’m so sorry I had to.” Aaron whimpered as sat in the dirt with his secret task card crinkled in his bloodied fist. 



“Tell me what you did right now! What the hell does your card say? Show us!” James yelled as he stood to his feet. 



Just as James was about to jump onto Aaron, Henry reached into his pocket and pulled out some matches we used to start small campfires while we had been on the run. We all stood still waiting to see what he was about to do as he lit 3 matches and threw them into the nearby hay bales, igniting the whole inside of the barn. Without hesitation, AJ saw the opportunity and stomped on my ankle as hard as she could. If it wasn't broken before, it sure was now. I looked down at it to see it now bent sideways. She then stomped on my other ankle. Not breaking it but making it so I couldn't walk. She moved her token 12 spaces. Even Though I was in agony from the pain, I still felt such an intense high from her moving so many spaces.   



Aaron dropped his card in the midst of everything happening. James fell to his feet to see the card and started to weep as he read it out loud.



“*Secret card: Kill James’ mom. Move 30 spaces.*” He said with anger bubbling up. “I can't believe you would do that for a dumb game. How…how could you do this to me?”



“I couldn't control myself! Come on you know what I mean, I couldn't control myself. Don't do anything you will regret!” Aaron said cautiously.



“Oh, I think it's a little too late for *not doing things we regret*.” James said as he jumped onto Aaron, choking him with all his strength. It seemed at that moment he was able to break free from the control of the game. He wasn't feeling the high of someone else completing a task. He just felt hate. *Red hot hate.*



I was overwhelmed, to say the least. The barn was in flames, James was trying to kill Aaron, and to make matters worse, AJ out of nowhere jumped up and dug a pocket knife into Brie's stomach. Now Brie and AJ were in a fighting match too.



Henry and I sat across from each other in disbelief at our surroundings. He looked at me with death in his eyes as he reached for a card. It wasn't even his turn but I don't think he cared anymore. He knew the others would be occupied for a while. 



The fire was getting bad. I knew I had to get out of that barn as soon as I could. Because of the damage done to my ankles, I couldn't walk so I dragged my body out of the barn. Taking the game with me. I made it a few feet and looked back to see Henry not moving. He set his card down on the board before I started to drag it with me and I read it as I continued to crawl *‘Secret card: let the fire overtake you. Move your token to the finish line and win the game.’*



I was able to get out of the barn with the board game in hand. I sat and watched as the flames overtook Henry. He didn't even flinch when he caught on fire. As I saw it happen I moved his token to the end space so he could win the game. I felt an intense high overtake my body as the game was complete.



Only a few moments after Henry caught fire, the whole barn came down. With all my friends in it. I looked at the burning barn and then back down at the game. I'm ashamed to say that my biggest worry was not knowing who I'd play with now. I hate myself for thinking that, but that's how all the game is. 



I tried to start a new game by myself and drew a card but that's when I saw the sirens of police cars and fire trucks pull up next to me. 



I was immediately surrounded by people trying to give me medical attention, taking me away from my game. I scratched and threw my body around like a toddler not getting their way. I remember them giving me some kind of sedative and waking up in the hospital. I was the only person to make it out alive that night. All I could say to the doctors and my parents was that I needed the game. That I had to play the game. It was the only meaning to life. It was the only reason I had to live. 



My parents got me a great lawyer and I got out of everything by pleading insanity. Our families all knew the right people and had the right money to ensure the word never got out about the deaths. They even managed to make the death of James’ mom disappear.



When they told me my friends were all dead I didn't have much of a reaction. I just kept asking where the game was. When they eventually told me the game was gone and never coming back, that's when I lost it. They had to put me into restraints because I kept hurting the hospital staff from my meltdowns. I started to threaten the staff and told them all the horrible things that would happen to them if they didn't get that game back to me. 



I eventually ended up in a psychiatric hospital. I yelled and screamed so much that I never had my voice. I hardly ever slept because all I thought about was the game and how I craved to play it again. My skin was red and torn up from my insistent picking due to the withdrawals. 



After months, I felt numb. Maybe from all the drugs they pumped me up with or perhaps I was so used to the withdrawals I didn't feel it as much. It still felt like I had an uncontrollable urge inside my bones, but I was able to hide it. They then sent me home after a while. I knew I had to mask my emotions for the game. Pretend I didn't care anymore. Even if it killed me inside to say it out loud. 



I walked into my bedroom and I felt like I was being treated like a baby. My old bed frame was gone and it was just the mattress on the floor. All my sharp shelves were taken down, along with anything else I could possibly hurt myself with. I rolled my eyes but knew my parents had to make these changes for me to even come home. 



I sat on my bed and I looked around at my room. Now with a doorknob that locked from the outside to keep me in, as well as bars on my windows. 



I searched my room desperately to find something to take up my mind. That's when I dug through my closet and I saw it. I saw that beautiful colorful box that I came to know so well, just hiding in the back of my closet waiting to be found. I knew It came back the first time it was destroyed, but it was feeling like it was a one-time thing. But here it was. Patiently waiting for me to come and play it. I ripped open the box, giving myself a papercut in the process, and started to play the game by myself. 



With all that being said, I can finally say ‘task completed’ and share what my first card said in that solo game. 



*‘Secret card: Spread the word about this game online so more people can join us. Move 20 spaces.'*



So what do ya say? Care to come join me for a game?

**I've been asked to foster my son's best friend, I don't know how to react.**



I have one son, Henry, aged 12. Henry is best friends with a boy named Archie, aged 14. It has always been clear that Archie comes from a troubled home. From what I can gather (and I do not have the full information), Archie's mum is a drug addict, and Archie has been on the at-risk register for a long while. Honestly, I don't know why it has taken them this long to decide he is being moved into foster care.

Last Friday, I received a call from my son's school, saying they couldn't discuss it with me but asked if I would give them consent for my information to be passed on to Archie's social worker. I agreed, and not long after, I had a call from his social worker explaining that a section something-or-other was being put in place, which meant that Archie was going to be removed from his home and placed into foster care. I was told that the school had recommended me and asked to see if I could take him in, basically. They said it would likely be long-term until he turns 18. I honestly didn't know what to say; I was in shock.

I have been unofficially supporting Archie for a while now. I pick him up from his house and drop him off at school with my son. He spends a lot of weekends at my place. On days where he doesn't come to my place, I make sure to pack him something to eat when I pick him up because he told me that his school lunch is his only meal most days. I buy him soap and deodorant, and I even wash his clothes for him.

But supporting however I can and taking him on fully is a big jump. I'm a single dad. I have a decent job, but I'm far from well-off. I live in a small two-bedroom house, meaning Henry and Archie would have to share a room (which they do now when Archie stays, but it's only for short bursts). Plus, there's the responsibility of taking on another human.

I was told that they had a lack of foster carers in the local area, so if I didn't agree to take him, it is likely he would have to move counties and schools. I don't want that. I was already having Archie stay with me for the two-week Christmas holiday, so I asked if I could think about it and give them a firm answer in the new year. They agreed. Archie has not yet been informed about any of this. I've tried to make this a normal Christmas for him, as much as possible.

My heart is telling me, ""Of course, you're going to take that little boy in,"" but my brain is worried about the responsibility and cost of taking on another mouth to feed, another boy to clothe.

At the same time, I keep thinking about Archie’s situation. He has already had such a rough start in life, and I know he needs stability and care more than anything else. I can’t bear the thought of him being uprooted again, losing his school, his friends, and the small semblance of normality he has here. I keep asking myself if I can really give him what he needs, and I don’t know if I have all the answers right now.

I’ve always taught Henry the importance of kindness, and I see how much he cares about Archie too. Part of me feels that this might not just be me taking on more responsibility—it’s also about giving him the chance to grow up with a sense of love and belonging.

So, I suppose I’m left balancing what’s practical with what feels right in my heart.And I’m leaning towards saying yes.

I spoke to my own mum about it, and she thinks it’s an awful idea. She’s worried I’m biting off more than I can chew, especially as a single dad. She reminded me that I already have a lot on my plate with work, the house, and raising Henry on my own. She said that taking in another child, especially one with a difficult background, would add stress and might affect my ability to provide for Henry properly. She didn’t say it outright, but I could tell she’s afraid this might make life harder for all of us, including Archie. I understand her concerns—honestly, I do.

But I can’t imagine just turning him away when he needs help the most. I told her that I haven’t made a final decision yet, but that I need to think about what’s best for everyone involved, not just what’s easiest.

And I haven’t even discussed any of this with Henry yet, which will be a huge factor in my final decision.

This has been a huge rant, and if you've read it thank you. I just needed to get this out somehow.

*Couple of thoughts:*

*It's 4 years. Like, obviously kids need support well beyond 18 if you can provide it, but if you can get that kid to graduate high school, you would already be a saint, and nothing more could be expected of you. So it's not forever. Also, once that kid is 16, he can start working and helping around the house more legitimately. Both things are not just for your benefit, but also great things for him to learn.*

*Ask social services what additional resources you'd have access to if you were to foster. For example, here where I live foster kids qualify for free school lunches. So that's a cost you don't have to incur. I would also find a local foster parent group as im sure there are other resources available that may not even be ran by the state*

*Real talk: if it was me, I would do it as long as I didn't think that Archie would be a danger to Henry - like, unless you think Archie could be violent or a sexual predator kind of kid.*

*If he's a good kid, I would do everything in my power to make that happen. I would set up a gofund me if necessary, I would try to lean on my friends and family to help.*

*Also, depending on what your job is, I would ask if they can help in any way (I say this as someone who works for a giant company).*

*Yes, I would worry. But a 14 year old kid in foster care is not something I'd be able to let happen to a kid I care about.*



**caffeine\_pleaz**

*I'm a single dad to two foster children. Started much the same way. Was asked to take in a youth of a friend of the family's. I've been fostering for a few years now. It's by far one of the best decisions I've ever made. Hell yeah it's an adjustment but it's doable. Granted, I'm in Canada and can only speak for the agency I work with. But they've been great about helping with supports needed. There is funding for food, clothing, xmas and birthdays. You can get them to approve a certain number of paid respite hours per week. (I have a respite Worker for 25 hours per week. Which I'm sure as a single parent you can understand is a huge help.) And all the youth I've taken in over the last couple of years are always extremely grateful for a stable home.*

*That said, if you decide it's not for you, there's no shame. But if you do decide to do it, I assure you it's worth it. It's obvious you care about the kid. Which is probably already more than he's used to. Props to you for considering it.*



**Update - 5 days later**



I just wanted to come on and give an update. I want to say a huge thank you for all the responses. I genuinely didn’t expect to receive so many replies, especially to something that was just meant to be a rant to get my emotions out.

When I was asked to take in Archie, at first I felt honoured. Then I felt worried about everything. I am quite an anxious person in general, and my thoughts were flooded with concerns about whether I’d be good enough to support Archie in the way he needs. I love my mum, but she didn’t help. I think I get my anxiety from her, although she has it on a much higher scale than I do. Every possible thing that could go wrong, she was texting me about all week: “You’re already stretched thin with work and Henry,” “You won’t get 1-1 time with Henry anymore,” “How will you afford everything?” These are real concerns, and I’m glad she brought them up because they gave me the opportunity to think about how I could mitigate them.

A few of you mentioned the fostering allowance, which I knew about, but I couldn’t find any concrete information on how much it would actually be. Every source online seemed to give a different answer, but none suggested it was very much. However, as some of you advised, I called the social worker’s office and said I was seriously considering taking in Archie (which they were thrilled about), but I needed to understand the finances first to see if it was feasible. They said they couldn’t provide exact numbers, as every case is different and it isn’t decided until a placement is found. However, they told me the minimum would be around £190 (about $240 US) per week, and that it would likely be completely tax-free. Additionally, I’d receive a significant discount on things like council tax. That was honestly a lot more than I expected, and much higher than most of the figures I’d seen online. They also put me in touch with some other foster carers who answered my questions, which was incredibly helpful.

This week has been very busy. I worked out my finances, added the estimated fostering allowance, and calculated how much Archie would likely increase my expenses. It worked out that I’d actually have a surplus compared to my current situation. Many of the foster carers I spoke to don’t work full time, using the allowance to supplement their income. I’m not sure if I want to do that, but they mentioned it helps to work part-time since fostering involves a lot of work—meetings, reports, and other responsibilities. On top of that, I’d need to complete training during the first year to become fully qualified. I considered it, and with the additional allowance, I could move to a 0.6 contract (working three days per week) while still covering the costs of moving to a three-bedroom house. While that would leave me with slightly less disposable income, it wouldn’t be a significant reduction. I’ve spoken with my work, and they said they’d support me if I decided to do this, but I haven’t made a final decision. I don’t want it to seem like I’m taking advantage of Archie’s allowance.

After sorting out the finances, I needed to talk to Henry. This was honestly the most important part of my decision. If Henry said no, I’d struggle to go ahead with it. I took him out and explained the situation. I didn’t go into the details of why Archie is going into care, as it’s not my story to tell, even though Archie himself has been open about his rough home life. I discussed the potential challenges—less 1-1 time, less privacy (at least in the short term while we find a bigger house), and so on. Henry was incredibly supportive. He said that he and Archie had talked about how they both wished Archie could come and live with us. I told him not to mention anything to Archie yet until I had the chance to speak with him, and he agreed.

Yesterday, I arranged for social services to come over. Archie, his social worker, and I sat down to talk. They told Archie he was going to be placed in foster care. Archie cried a lot, I cried a lot, and he asked to see his mum, which the social worker said they’d arrange as soon as possible. In that moment, Archie didn’t seem like a teenager—he seemed like a small child whose world was crumbling. Then they asked Archie if he’d want to stay with me. Although he was still distraught about being in care, he said he’d love to stay with me. We discussed what it would mean and how it would affect us. Afterward, Archie and his social worker spoke privately, and then the social worker and I talked. They expressed how thrilled they were about my decision and said they were pleased I planned to move to a bigger house soon, as Archie would need his own space, which I fully agree with.

Normally, the boys spend most of their time upstairs playing Xbox, but later that day Archie came down and asked if we could watch a movie together. He sat next to me, rested his head on my shoulder, and said, “Thank you for letting me stay with you.” Writing this, I can feel tears welling up in my eyes again. I put my arm around him and said I’d always be there for him.

Today, Archie seems a little down, which is entirely understandable. I honestly expected him to take it harder than he has. To cheer him up, we’re going to see the new Lion King movie (even though I hate those live-action films, but this is for Archie!) and then going out to eat—letting the boys choose where.

I might return in a few months to give an update on how things are going. For now, I’m just hoping everything will be okay. I know the first few months will be the hardest.

Thank you everyone.

***Editor's Note - Stealing this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/s/ItLTSrniow) from u/Effective-Cricket-93 to explain what type of fostering is involved here***


It depends, this is called a “Friends and Family” placement in England, when social services have decided it’s in the child’s best interest to be placed with a familiar person rather than a traditional foster placement. Friends and family placements can have more of a loose set of restrictions than a traditional placement. But OOP would only be cleared to take in Archie, he wouldn’t for example be able to take in another child unless he decides to do full training. 

They would be able to make choices that would be different compared to a traditional foster home. For example, social services has to weigh up “there are no local foster homes, meaning his schooling would be disturbed, would lose friends and support network, how would that impact him?” With having to share a room. Especially considering Archie has already been sharing a room regularly 

Social services would be looking at what’s in the best interest of the child and that would allow them to make some concessions

Smallscale: Miniature Recipies for Miniature People,"Story: Smallscale
Setting: An alternate Earth, circa 1929; where exists a race of tiny, 5cm tall, bug like creatures known as the Miinu that live in hiding from humans. 
_________________________________________________

Another worldbuildy thing that didn't fit in the other posts and wanted to be a stand alone post. I often think about what kind of food creatures as small as the Miinu would eat. Harvesting large produce like we do would be difficult and impractical to store so I imagine they stick to foods that are more manageable to harvest. 

Beans, seeds, nuts, smaller fruits and vegetables are common for them to grow. They are also able to hunt and eat wild insects as a protein rich source of meat.

The image used is something I made for a little fantasy food competition and here I can explain each item in a little more detail:

**Bee Bread** is based on an actual product bees make in the wild. It's made from mixing pollen and honey and is used as food for the coloney. Pollen notably makes a decent replacement for flour, so the miinu will bake using that or acorn flour, rather than wheat flour.

**Roast Cricket Leg** is an example of how insect meat can be stripped of its hard shell and cooked.

**Candy Shards** are collected from pieces of human-made candies, which are often made from processed chemicals and sugars Miinu can't make themselves. Meanwhile **Honey Candies** are examples of natural, organic candy, often produced by the Bees.

**Algae Noodle Soup** is exactly what it sounds like. Miinu tend to branch out more than modern humans when it comes to food they can harvest eat, and cook.

**Nectar Wine**, showing that Miinu can and do produce alcohol, because everyone likes a drink every once in a while.

**Pickled Duckweed** takes a bland but plentiful vegitable and adds a bit more flavor by pickling it in salt and vinegar. 

**Grub Sandwhich**, made with polen bread, roasted beetle grub, guinea pig cheese, brussel sprout leaves, and slices of cherry tomato. Delicious.

**Loaded Baked Bean** - When a single bean is as big as a potato, you cook it like one.

**Clorophyl Dumplings**. Many miinu are capable of eating the high-fiber materials found in grass and plants. Sometimes they are ground up into a paste and turned into a grassy tasting dough that they then fill with meat or vegetables.",IbbyWonder6,2025-01-06,3076,worldbuilding
